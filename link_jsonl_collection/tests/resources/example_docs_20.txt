Those are all important, but the most asked question is, \u201cWhat\u2019s the 0-60 time?\u201d This is nothing more than a measure of how quickly a vehicle can reach the 60 mile per hour mark. It is a measure of acceleration of a vehicle. 0-60 times differ a great deal depending on the amount of power a motor puts out, of course. But anyone who spends any amount of time with car enthusiasts are sure to hear the ubiquitous term bantered around more often than most other metrics by which cars are measured in terms of power.\nThe only other measure that comes close as far as how acceleration is commonly measures in cars in the United States is the quarter mile time. Enthusiasts will often ask about how quickly a car can get through a quarter mile, but that can be seen as less accurate a estimate of acceleration than the amount of time it takes a vehicle to reach the sixty miler per hour mark. The quarter mile time can often have more variable such as driver experience.\nThe 0-60 mph speed is used as the standard in the United States, where the rest of the world prefers the 0-100 km version. But both measure the performance of a car. A lot goes into increasing 0-60 times in performance vehicles. As a normal rule of thumb, performance cars are considered those with 0-60 time of under 6 seconds, while Exotic cars will do 0-60 in 3 to 4 seconds. However, in most cases, a car isn\u2019t simply \u201cstuck with\u201d the acceleration number with which it was born. Engineers and designers work tirelessly to provide better and better numbers with each progressive model of performance and exotic cars. But, even the back yard mechanic or muscle car enthusiast can determine the 0-60 times of their cars and make moves to improve them.\nThe testing of acceleration is usually done on a closed course away from people other than the team that may be working on the specific car. This limits putting anyone in danger who is not part of the test or the ongoing project. Testers can use something as simple as a stop watch and the vehicle\u2019s speedometer. This is probably good enough for the typical muscle car enthusiast who is just looking for an estimate of how much power his latest improvements will give him. For engineers testing a new exotic sports car, though, a simple estimate is not accurate enough. They want hard and fast 0-60 times, and they use much more highly-technical equipment to get their numbers. With the 0-60 figure being so important in automobile sales, they do everything possible to ensure their numbers are incredibly accurate.\nIn professional testing situations, highly technical and accurate measuring devices are hooked to computers as the test is performed. The test is run in two different directions, to eliminate any influence of wind, an unseen downhill grade or any differences in traction. The average of these two times will be the recorded 0-60 time for the car. Doppler radar guns are used to ensure the tester is recording exact 0 -60 times. This leaves the driver to focus solely on running through the gears as precisely as possible and simply driving in a straight line. This allow for a more accurate measure, as does running the test first in one direction and then in the exact opposite direction.\nSome still feel, however, that listing one 0 \u2013 60 time is not truly indicative of what a new owner can expect from a performance or exotic car, or even a muscle car. Instead, some believe the measure should include a range of times rather than one finite mark to which all cars of any particular model should be held. For instance, they believe a BMW M3 should have a listed time of 3.9 \u2013 4.2 seconds and a Corvette Z06 should have a range from 3.6 to 4.0. These people believe that a range of numbers better represents what an owner can honestly expect to see when he or she takes delivery of a new vehicle.\nThis contingent of car enthusiasts and engineers believes that there is no way for either the time to 60 mph or even a quarter mile time to be completely accurate, as there are simply too many variables that come into play. No matter if you are a 0 \u2013 60 purist, or you believe that it is an inexact science, you can be sure that the measure itself will not be going away any time soon. It is still one of the biggest touted numbers for vehicles, and easier for people to relate to than horsepower and torque.", "docid": "msmarco_doc_00_0"}

To explain this, let us go\nto the beginning of what we can define as time. Let us presume that, before the big bang, there was only\nenergy, and no time. We can say that God was this energy. And \"then\" he decided\nto make things, so he converted this energy into massand hence was created the big bang, which was an explosion of the energy force turning\ninto matter. Exploding outwards in all directions, and creating the universe, or many\nuniverses, and therefore dimensions, where time is considered the fourth dimension.\nEverything is relative. A plant grows. We compare the states \"after\" and\n\"before\", and in our minds we think time. An object moves from point A to point\nB, or relative to what we call points A and B, the universe shifts around, we call it\nbefore and after, and label the \"time\" it took for that object to move between\nthese two points.\nFor us on earth, our reference point for time is the sun, the most obvious object in\nour sphere of perception, with its movement \"around us\". But in fact it is not\nmoving around us, but our earth is spinning. When the created particles exploded outward\nfollowing the big bang, because they were little particles of mass, they were attracted to\neach other, because mass objects are attracted to each other by gravity. We can stand on\nthe earth because we are a mass object attracted to the great (relative to us) mass object\nof the earth. A Chinese person is upside down compared to a US person, because they are on\nthe other side of the planet attracted and drawn by gravity to\nits centre.\nIn the same manner, all the\nlittle mass particles jetting outwards from the centre of the big bang explosion are\nattracted to one anotherby gravity. Some particles are closer\nto one another, and they start to form clusters and groups. The clusters and groups which\nare attracted towards each other do so like water going down a drain. The\nfastest and naturally most efficient way for the water to go down a drain is to start\nspinning, which also creates a hole in the centre through which air can escape upwards, as\nthe space the air previously consumed is now being replaced by the descending water. Water\ngoing down a drain in the southern hemisphere of our planet spins in the opposite directionas water going down the drain in the northern hemisphere.\nIn the same way when these mass particles start to\nattract to one another during our forming universe, they\nnaturally form a spinning disk, much like with\nthe water going down the drain. This big disk could\neventually form a galaxy, universe, or solar system, with the most clusters and mass in\nthe centre of the disk, all of it spinning around.\nOn a solar system level (solar means a sun), the most mass in the centre can form a\nsun, like ours. There is so much mass that the sheer weight of all these mass particles,\nattracted to one another under gravity, becomes so great that the pressure eventually\nignites and starts a chemical reaction. Under the sheer weight of it all, and pressure,\nthe chemical reaction converts hydrogen and helium back into energy, which we see as\nlight and feel as heat.\nThe mass of our earth is also a lot, and the weight and pressure of this mass is great enough that, if we were to bore a hole 3 km towards the centre of the earth, the pressure\nand heat would be strongenough to meltall our equipment (which are basically made from the iron ore found in our\nearth's, cooled crust). We are actually sitting on a very thin crust, the outer\nlayer of the earth, which has cooled downto the point that we\ncan stand on it(although, in the earlier days of the earth's\ndevelopment, the crust was mostly molten lava and exploding volcanoes, and it took a long\ntime to cool down to where it is now). Past 3 km from the surface it is still all molten lava, which occasionally escapes to the surface\nthrough volcanoes or largeearthquakes. But our earth is not\nlarge enough to ignite the reaction which createsenergy (which is conversion of mass back into energy) to turn it\ninto a star. But Jupiterhas just enough mass to make it a small star. There are other stars in the universe which\nare such a large collection of mass and produce so much gravity that they do not even let\nlight escape, sucking everything into it.\nFor the same reason that the particles of mass travelling outwards from the initial big bang have drawn together in spinning disks, the hazy mass within the\nforming and spinning solar systems have also conglomerated into spinning matter,\neventually forming spinning planets, now revolving around the sun at the same speed as the\nforming solar disk was previously spinning. There are two interesting theories regarding\nthe relative distance of the planets from the sun. One was postulated by Galileo < who\ndrew geometric shapes with an increasing number of sides, and found that they perfectly\nfit into one another <link and add picture> . Another theory < calculates that\nthe relative distances of the planets from the sun correlate exactly with the relative\ndistance between the frequencies of musical notes, whereby F# would be the asteroid belt,\nand hence deemed an unstable orbit and where a planet could not form properly. This is\njust one example of the amazing harmony of nature, which one can also consider as proof of\nthe divine existence of God.\nTherefore, we have our sun in the centre of our own solar system, and our planet spins in an orbit around it, our planet itself spinning around, with the\nmoon spinning in an orbit around us.\nPrague's\nOrloj Clock- an\ninteresting history\nAs our planet spins, it appears to us that the sun revolves around us. The Sumerians(the\nrace of people living in Mesopotamia in what is now modern day\nIraq and from where Abraham first came and was called by God)were the first great civilisation on earth and which defined for us time, using another\nvery common object for us: our hands and fingers. If we were a Sumerian, how might we divide up a day, which is\nbasically the time it takes for our earth to spin around once, or from our perspective,\nfor our sun to revolve around us until it came\nback to the same place it started at? Well, we might look\nat our hands and fingers and use them to divide up things. We\nwould divide up the entire day into two: the dark half and the light half. We have four\nfingers and a thumb. Looking at the four fingers, each has three segments, making up 12 segments total. Three segments times four fingers makes\n12, so let us divide up each half day into 12 hours. Now if we take this number 12\ngenerated by the four fingers of our left hand, and multiply it by the fingers and thumb\nof our right hand, we get 12 hours times 5, which makes 60. So lets divide each hour into\n60 individual minutes, and divide up each minute into 60 individual seconds. And this is\nprecisely how we humans have defined for ourselves time. A year, which works out to 365\ndays (with some leap years, because our means of creating time is not exact), is the\nnumber of times the earth spins around its own axis (creating what we call a day) while\nthe earth revolves in its orbit around the sun to come back to the same place it started\nat.\nThis is how the Sumerians defined\ntime. But because the world is a round globe, the beginning of night and day is different\ndepending on where you are located in the world. What is high noon for someone in the US\nwould be pitch black midnight for someone in China, on the other side of the world. Therefore, over time, we humans started to draw imaginary lines on the planet, cutting up\nthe planet into 24 parts, one for each hour of the day.\nIn the days of old, people used a sundial to tell the time, which is basically a solar\nclock. A little stick at a certain angle which would cast a shadow as the sun, from our\nperspective, would revolve around our planet. But as humans advanced, and with the\ninvention of railroads (the first time zone GMT was in fact created by British Railways),\nand transportation becoming faster and faster, it got to a point where it was necessary to\nset some relative times between each place. So the earth was carved into one hour slices,\nusually along political borders, or what we humans thought would be the best way. This way, if ever taking a train, you would know exactly what time you\nshould arrive at a certain city, which fell in a certain time zone, subtract or add the\nnumber of hours on your clock, and everything started to make better sense for our\ndeveloping societies.\nDuring humanity\u2019s development, the period during all this defining was when England\nwas a great power in the world, controlling many colonies. And with such power during this\ndevelopment, and such a strong naval power, in 1675 they labelled the centre of our time\nin Greenwich, and defined Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as the zero time zone to help ships\nnavigate the world and define longitudinal lines, such that the remaining parts of the\nworld were either plus or minus so many hours from this zeropoint. The sun rises from our west and sets in our east. So if we move along the planet\nwestwards, we are going back in our little created time, towards the morning of the time\nzone we are moving towards. Likewise, if we fly east, we are flying towards the setting\nsun, towards the end of the day, and hence we would add time to our clock. But in the big\nscheme of things, the time in the universe is steady, whereby we\nare only adding or subtracting hours on our own clock, simply\nfor the convenience of defining for us what is morning and what is evening(in terms of the angle of the sun with reference to the point on the globe\nthat we are stationed at). And if we go far enough west or east, meaning 12 hours\nin either direction from the GMT zero time, we will end up on the other side of the world\nfrom Greenwich England, where we could add or subtract half a day. So on one side of this\nother imaginary line it is a day later or earlier than on the other side. But this is just\nhow we have divided up things, based on our fingers and the rotation of the earth and sun.\nIn the big scheme of things, time is constant, and God is\neternal. God, in whose eyes \"a day is like a thousand years\", and\nwho is \"the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end\". Things\ncontinue as they continue, and are as they are, but we humans, for our own convenience,\nhave divided up everything according to the number of segments on our fingers. And we wake\nup hurriedly every morning to catch the 6:50 bus, to get to work by 9:00. These are all\nour own inventions.\nAnd then we have daylight savings, which is the adding or\nsubtracting of an hour to or from a particular time zone and at\na particular time of the year, to help the farmer get up early to begin work in his field. But over time, the farmer did not have such an importor dominant role in society. Some areas use daylight savings while\nothers do not. Recently, the US has shifted the time when it applies daylight savings\nbecause it has calculated it can save its economy billions of dollars by not forcing\npeople to use their airconditioners so much at work .\nSo whatever time zone you are located in on this planet, and you are working on a\ntranslation assignment for KENAX, let\nus just agree on a delivery time based on the GMT time zone.

If you are in New York, so EST-5 (5 hours\nearlier than London, as the sun travels\nwestward), you should get to London10 hours\nlater than when you left, so 16:15 (assuming you were leaving in the\nmorning), which would be 4:15pm in London(you are flying eastwards, AGAINST the sun). Hope I figured this out right\nand will try to make some script to compute this for people.\nthe way you mix\nspirituality and science is incredible :)\nThanks, but many scientists believe in God and\nscientists have done some rudimentary scientific research on psychic powers,\nfor example. Science does not automatically mean a lack of spirituality and\nmany things are connected that we do not understand yet. Think of the\nunified theory of relativity.

Spoken in South Africa.\nAfrikaans, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sesotho (the Sesotho name for Southern Sotho), Setswana (the Setswana name for Tswana), Swazi (also known as Siswati), Tsonga (also known as Xitsonga), Venda (also isiVenda), Xhosa (also isiXhosa) and Zulu (also isiZulu) are 10 of the official languages of South Africa (the last and eleventh being English). All these languages are therefore predominantly spoken in South Africa.\n\nAkkadian\nAkkadian is one of the great cultural languages of world history. Akkadian (or Babylonian-Assyrian) is the collective name for the spoken languages of the culture in the three millennia BCE in Mesopotamia, the area between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, approx. covering modern Irak. The name Akkadian --so called in ancient time-- is derived from the city-state of Akkad, founded in the middle of the third millennium BCE and capital of one of the first great empires after the dawn of human history.\n\nAmharic\nThe National Language of Ethiopia.\n\nArabic\nArabic is spoken by almost 200 million people in more than twenty two countries, from Morrocco to Iraq, and as far south as Somalia and the Sudan. As the language of Quran, the Holy book of Islam, it is thought as a first language in Muslim states throughout the world. Arabic language originated in Saudi Arabia in pre-Islamic times, and spread rapidly across the Middle East.\n\nBambara\nThe language of Bambara or Bamana is spoken in Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso. This language are also used as \"lingua franca\" in West Africa.\n\nBerber\nGroup of languages, from Morocco to Egypt. Differences between the languages can be considerable, due to geographical distances. There are about 300 local dialects. The largest of the Berber languages is found in Kabylia in Algeria. Berber languages form a branch of the Afro-Asiatic linguistic family.\n\nCoptic\nThe Coptic Language is the name used to refer to the last stage of the written Egyptian language. Coptic should more correctly be used to refer to the script rather than the language itself. Even though this script was introduced as far back as the 2nd century BC., it is usually applied to the writing of the Egyptian language from the first century AD. to the present day.\nCoptic was used from its Christian beginnings in the late second century AD. till the time of the Great persecution of Diocletian in the early 4th century AD. predominantly as a translational tool from Greek to Egyptian. After the persecution, the monastic movement picked up tremendous steam. It was for the Copts the only way they can express their great love for God, that they earlier expressed with the willing sacrifice of their most precious possession, their earthly lives. These monastic communities were large and mostly Egyptian. This generated the need for the abbots of these communities to write their rules in their own language, i.e. Coptic. Also the Fathers of the Coptic Church, who usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Coptic.\n\nDamara/Nama\nDamara/Nama, a clicking language, is spoken in Namibia.\n\nEgyptian\nThe language spoken in Egypt. The New Egyptian language is also known as the \"Demotic\" language since it is the colloquial Egyptian spoken by the people. The gradual replacement of Hieroglyphic by Demotic is similar to the replacement of Latin by English French, Italian, etc. Coptic is the common colloquial Egyptian. Its roots stem from from the New Egyptian Language and has a large similitude with the version of the the Egyptian Language of the 25th Kingdom (Saees Kingdom named after its Capital: Sa-ElHahgar).\n\nFula\nFULA (FULBF, FELLATAIT or PEuL5), a numerous and powerful African people, spread over an immense region from Senegal nearly to Darfur. Strictly they have no country of their own, and nowhere form the whole of the population, though nearly always the dominant native race. They are most numerous in Upper Senegal and in the countries under French sway immediately south of Senegambia, notably Futa Jallon. Farther east they rule, subject to the control of the French, Segu and Massena, countries on both banks of the upper Niger, to the south-west of Timhuktu. The districts within the great bend of the Niger have a large Fula population.\n\nGujarati\nGujarati is one of the widely spoken languages of India. It is mainly spoken in the western state of Gujarat in India. Gujarati speaking people have immigrated to many countries worldwide. Some of them are: US, UK, Kenya, South Africa, Fiji New Zealand etc.\n\nHausa\nHausa is spoken in Nigeria and Niger. This language are also used as \"lingua franca\" in West Africa.\n\nIraqi\nThe language spoken in Iraq.\n\nLebanese\nThe language spoken in Lebanon. Levantine Arabic is a general designation used for a continuum of dialects spoken in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Israel. Another name for the cluster is Northwest Arabian Colloquial Arabic. There are 7 million speakers in Syria, almost 4 million in Lebanon, 3 million in Jordan, and 1 million in Israel and Palestine.\n\nLingala\nLingala = Center and north. Primarily in Zadre. Niger-Congo, Atlantic-Congo, Volta-Congo, Benue-Congo, Bantoid, Southern, Narrow Bantu, Northwest, C, Bangi-Ntomba. Lingala belongs to the Ngala Group of Bantu (Guthrie C36) and is spoken along the Lomami, the Ubangi, and the Zaire rivers as far as Kinshasa in Zaire, as well as up the Sangha River through Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic. UBS (1982) notes an exaggerated figure of 8.4 million speakers, the same figure that Grimes (1996) cites as including second language speakers. World Almanac (1998) estimates 8 million total speakers. Heine (1970), citing Roberts (1962), gives 1.2 million.\n\nLuganda\nThe language of Uganda. Luganda, the native language of the people of Buganda, developed over the centuries as a spoken language. Its written form is only as recent as the arrival of the Arab and European influence among the Baganda. It is not easy, and of course it is not within the scope of this discussion, to trace its origins, but it is proper to assume that in a dynamic society with such well structured cultural, social, and political institutions like those of the Baganda, the language must have experienced a reciprocal influence during most of the changes the society went through over the course of its history. It was not however, until after the second half of the nineteenth century, that Luganda was first written down and appeared in print in its own right.\n\nMalagasy\nThe language of Madagascar. More than anything else, the people of Madagascar love oratory. The colorful language, Malagasy, like the people who use it, is a living synthesis of Indonesian, African, and Arabic elements. No conversation is complete without a liberal sprinkling of clever euphemisms and timeworn proverbs. The British missionaries attempted to codify this lyrical language, using the letters of the English alphabet. The Malagasy alphabet is therefore quite similar to the English alphabet, with the following exceptions: The Malagasy alphabet is missing the letters C, Q, U, W, and X. The letter A is always short (as in watch). The letter E sounds like a long A (as in pace). The letter i is pronounced like a long E (as in bean). The letter J sounds like dz. Finally, the letter O sounds like oo.\n\nMandinka\nA language of Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal and spoken widely throughout Western Africa.\n\nMoroccan\nThe language of Morocco. One of the first things one notices about Morocco is its linguistic diversity. French, Berber, Modern Standard Arabic, as well as Moroccan Arabic, can all be heard in all the major cities. This is due primarily to the rich historical past of the country. The Berbers, the original inhabitants, make up roughly half of the population, and the three major dialects of their language are widely spoken. When the Arabs came to Morocco in the 8th century they brought their language, which has evolved into the Moroccan Arabic of today. France officially entered the picture in 1912 when it began the Moroccan protectorate and French is still widely used in commerce and the educational system.\nWhen one speaks of Arabic in Morocco there are two languages to be considered. On the one hand there is Modern Standard Arabic. This is the direct descendant of the language of the Koran and is understood throughout the contemporary Arab world. In Morocco it is used in newspapers, correspondence, news broadcasts and speeches but rarely in conversation. Moroccan Arabic, on the other hand, is the first language of the majority of Moroccans and really the most useful language to know when traveling in the country. It differs from Modern Standard Arabic to the extent that non-Moroccan speakers of Arabic, with the possible exception of Algerians and Tunisians, find it difficult to understand.\n\nMuganda\nBuganda is located in the south-central region of the country known today as Uganda, as shown in the map below. This is right in the heart of Africa, astride the equator, and at the source of the great river Nile. The people of Buganda are referred to as Baganda (the singular form is Muganda), their language is referred to as Luganda, and they refer to their customs as Kiganda customs. Sometimes the generic term Ganda is used for all the above (especially by foreign scholars).\n\nNdebele\nThe term Ndebele refers to a relatively broad range of ethnic groups dispersed across Zimbabwe and the Transvaal province of South Africa. Although they are not kindred in origin, language, or culture, all of these groups are undoubtedly descendants of a proto-Nguni tribe, as are the Xhosa and Zulu, and were resident in what is now KwaZulu and Natal as long as four centuries ago.\n\nNepali\nThe language of Nepal. In structure, Nepali is considered to lie in the middle between Hindi and the East Indic Bengali language. As well as in the East Indic tongues, its vowels have lost a distinction in length. Consonants of Nepali include four series of stops (principal, aspirated, retroflex, retroflex aspirated), a number of sibilants and affricates.\nNepali has totally lost the gender category; its numerous analytical forms, especially those of the verb, are now in process of forming the agglutinative declension system. The Indic ergative construction is not so active as in other languages of the group.\n\nNigerian\nSeveral languages are spoken in Nigeria\nDegema\nEdo\nEfik\nEnglish\nEsan\nHausa\nIbibio\nIdoma\nIgala\nIgbo\nIkwere\nIsekiri\nIsoko\nKalabari\nNupe\nOkobo\nOron\nPidgin\nTiv\nUrhobo\nYoruba\n\nNuer\nThe Nuer is one of the best known of all ethnographic studies, and the reason for this is clear: Evans-Pritchard gives a brilliant and insightful picture of an interesting and unusual people. The Nuer were a pastoral people living along the upper Nile, who had no laws or leaders and were strongly individualistic, with social order maintained by community values and a segmentary tribal and lineage system.\nNumbering approximately one million, the Nuer are the second largest people group (second to the Dinka) in south Sudan. Traditionally, they are cattle herders whose complete way of life revolves around their livestock. Cattle are used for payment of fines and debts and as bride prices in marriage. Children mold clay figures of cows out of clay, ash, wood or any other available material. Young boys have a favorite ox who they give a name and treat as if it was a puppy.\n\nOromo\nThe Oromo language is the third largest language of Africa in the number of native speakers. Afaan Oromo is spoken by over 30 million people in Ethiopa. Afaan Oromo is a language of very beautiful poetry, proverbs of wisdom, and justice. Even though the Oromos are spread over large areas and were prevented from using their language in education, mass media, and public services, the language is still a relatively uniform language with which Oromos from all parts of Ethiopia, and outside Ethiopia, can communicate with relative ease. Colonial Ethiopian governments from Menelik II down to Haile Sellasie, and to some extent the Derg forbade the study, development, and use of the Oromo language in education, public services, and other events including religious teachings, and scholarly studies.\n\nPersian\nAs the second language of the Muslim world and the main language of the Iranian cultural and civililzation literary, mystical, countless precious works in different literary, mystical, philosophical, theological, historical, artistic, and religious areas, Persian has always caught the attention of Iranians and other people in different countries of the world.\n\nPidgin English\nPidgin English = dialect spoken in Occidental Cameroon.\nA Pidgin (and also a Creole) is a language variety used for interethnic contact. In many cases where peoples of different linguistic groups come need to communicate, they use a third language (or material of a third language), in which they have some competence. As a result thereof, the language in question may undergo drastic changes and result in an entirely new language.\n\nSaudi\nThe language which people speak in the Arab world is far more different than Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is the language of the media. It is used on TV and newspapers, but it is not used anywhere else. Saudi Arabic, is the colloquial form of MSA. There aren't much change in the meaning, but the pronunciation differ from that of any other colloquial Arabic, though the saudi Arabic could be classified under (Gulf Arabic). e.g. in MSA, \"How are you?\" is translated as \"Kayfa Haluka\", while in Saudi, it would be \"keef Halak\", while in Bahrini and Kuwaiti, it would be \"Eish Loonak\", the worst, however, is the egyptian \"Izzayyak\".\n\nSesotho\nSesotho, or Southern Sotho, is spoken in Lesotho, the Free State, the northern part of the Eastern Cape Province and the south of the Gauteng province of South Africa. It is also spoken in the vicinity of Pretoria and Brits.\nSesotho is used by 3 104 197 speakers as a home language in South Africa (1996 census).\nSesotho was one of the first African languages to be reduced to writing, and it has an extensive literature. According to scholars the written form was originally based on the Tlokwa dialect. Today the written language is mostly based on the Kwena and Fokeng dialects. Although there are variations.\n\nShona\nThe language of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Shona, or chiShona, is a language spoken by nearly 80 percent of people in Zimbabwe. There are several regional Shona dialects. Written Shona is constantly evolving. Unfortunately the language is deteriorating because of the tendency to assimilate foreign languages.\n\nSomali\nThe Somali language, one of the major languages in Africa, is spoken in Somalia /Somaliland, Kenya, Ethiopia and the Republic of Djibouti. In fact, it is one of the few that have 10 million or more native speakers in Africa. There are also communities of Somali speakers in most countries in East Africa, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.\n\nSotho (Northern)\nAmongst the immense diversity of the languages of Africa one finds the Bantu languages which number close to a thousand including dialects. Within the South\u00adeastern zone of the Bantu language family, sub\u00adgroups such as the Sotho and Nguni groups, Tsonga and Venda are distinguished, Northern Sotho belongs to the Sotho group together with Tswana and Southern Sotho. Geographically speakers of Northern Sotho are mostly concentrated in the Northern and North\u00adeastern parts of the Transvaal. There are about 3,5 million mother\u00adtongue speakers.\nTypologically Northern Sotho is an agglutinative language. It is characterised by a system of noun classes and concordial agreement. Concordance is established by means of prefixal elements. Tone plays an important role in distinguishing the lexical meaning of words, but is also used to determine the grammatical character of words.\n\nSotho (Southern)\nSesotho, or Southern Sotho, is spoken in Lesotho, the Free State, the northern part of the Eastern Cape Province and the south of the Gauteng province of South Africa. It is also spoken in the vicinity of Pretoria and Brits.\nSesotho is used by 3 104 197 speakers as a home language in South Africa (1996 census).\nSesotho was one of the first African languages to be reduced to writing, and it has an extensive literature. According to scholars the written form was originally based on the Tlokwa dialect. Today the written language is mostly based on the Kwena and Fokeng dialects. Although there are variations.\n\nSwahili\nThe language of Kenya and East Africa.\nThe Swahili language, is basically of Bantu (African) origin. It has borrowed words from other languages such as Arabic probably as a result of the Swahili people using the Quran written in Arabic for spiritual guidance as Muslims.\nAs regards the formation of the Swahili culture and language, some scholars attribute these phenomena to the intercourse of African and Asiatic people on the coast of East Africa. The word \"Swahili\" was used by early Arab visitors to the coast and it means \"the coast\". Ultimately it came to be applied to the people and the language.\nRegarding the history of the Swahili language, the older view linked to the colonial time asserts that the Swahili language originates from Arabs and Persians who moved to the East African coast. Given the fact that only the vocabulary can be associated with these groups but the syntax or grammar of the language is Bantu, this argument has been almost forgotten. It is well known that any language that has to grow and expand its territories ought to absorb some vocabulary from other languages in its way.\n\nSwazi\nXhosa, Zulu, Swazi, and Ndebele are languages in the Nguni group of Bantu (Guthrie S40). Xhosa is spoken in the Transkei coastal region of South Africa; Zulu, south of Swaziland inland and along the coast; Swazi, in Swaziland; all three are spoken in South Africa.\n\nTsonga\nAfrikaans, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sesotho (the Sesotho name for Southern Sotho), Setswana (the Setswana name for Tswana), Swazi (also known as Siswati), Tsonga (also known as Xitsonga), Venda (also isiVenda), Xhosa (also isiXhosa) and Zulu (also isiZulu) are 10 of the official languages of South Africa (the last and eleventh being English). All these languages are therefore predominantly spoken in South Africa.\n1,646,000 in South Africa (1995), 4.2% of the population (1995 The Economist). Population total all countries 3,165,000. Transvaal. Also spoken in Mozambique, Swaziland, Zimbabwe. Partially intelligible with Ronga and Tswa. National language. A language of secondary education. Newspapers, radio programs. Christian, traditional religion. Bible 1907-1989.\n\nTswana\nTswana, more correctly called Setswana, is another of the Bantu languages of southern Africa. Its speakers, the Tswana, number about 4 million\u20143 million of whom live in South Africa, and one million in the neighboring country of Botswana, which is named after them. Tswana is closely related to the Sotho language and, in fact, is often referred to as Western Sotho.\nA Bantu language. National Language of Botswana, which is named after the language; The majority of Tswana speakers are in South Africa but there are also speakers in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Internationally there are about 4 million speakers.\nThe language is closely related to Sotho and is in the Niger-Congo family of languages. It has also been known as Beetjuans, Chuana, Coana, Cuana, Setswana and Sechuana.\n\nVenda\nVenda is spoken/used in South Africa\n\nWolof\nWolof is a language spoken in the west African nations of Senegal and Coastal Gambia. Compared to isiXhosa or isiZulu, this language is fairly easy to learn and to enunciate.\n\nXhosa\nXhosa is a \"dominant language\" (Grobler et al.1990) in about three dozen districts of Eastern Cape Province and adjacent Orange Free State, and in the Transkei and Ciskei (all in South Africa). It is also spoken as a dominant language in several districts away from the main Xhosa region: in Petrusburg near Bloemfontein, and in the mining districts of Oberholzer and Westonaria, southwest of Johannesburg. Speakers of Xhosa total about 6.5 million. It is the most widely distributed African language in South Africa, although not the most spoken: Zulu has more speakers. Other speakers are found in major population centers throughout the Republic of South Africa. Afrikaans and English are official languages of South Africa, but Xhosa is a declared official language in Ciskei, along with English, and the official language in Transkei, although English, Afrikaans, and other African vernaculars are used for judicial, legislative, and administrative purposes (McFerren 1985).\n\nYoruba\nYoruba is spoken by about 30 million people in southwestern Nigeria, Benin, and northern Togo. Yoruba joins Hausa and Igbo as the most widely spoken languages in Nigeria. Although this member of the Benue Congo group of languages has about 20 distinct dialects, Standard Yoruba is recognized by speakers of all dialects and is used in education, literature, and the media.\n\nZulu\nThis prominent group of the Nguni people takes its name from the chief who founded the royal line in the 16th century. The warrior king, Shaka, raised the tribe to prominence in the early 19th century. The complicated Zulu etiquette was refined during his reign. The current monarch of the Zulu nation is King Goodwill Zweletini.\nThe language Zulu, or isiZulu, is understood by people from the Cape to Zimbabwe. Zulu is also the written language of the Northern Nguni. It's also a tonal language.\nPartner links:\nhttp://www.amlingua.com\nAMlingua provides Russian translation and transcription services by professional Russian translators.

Also links to useful translation tips.\nTranslator or Translation Rates, Charges, Prices and Fees\nThis page was written because many applying translators\nasked us for advice on what is a good translation rate and price to charge. If\nyou are a customer and would like to know our rates as a translation company,\nplease contactus directly, or check out our\ntranslation pricespage.\nSearching for \u201ctranslation\u201d on google will yield\napproximately 140 million results, making the translation industry very\ncompetitive indeed. Almost anyone can put a webpage together, and with roughly\n85% of the world population speaking at least two languages, you\u2019ve got\nsomething to contend with. Once you\u2019ve established a reputation for yourself and\npicked up a few steady customers you can start increasing your prices, but when\nbeginning your translation career it can be difficult to choose a rate to\ncharge. Below you will find various suggestions how to develop a pricing\nstrategy for your translation services.\nIf youare just starting\nout you may consider charging on the lower end, to help you get your foot in the\ndoor. After managing a translation company for 20 years and receiving lots of\ntender applications, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find quality translators in the\nfollowing price ranges:  \nWork\nat Home Translation Jobs\nEnglish/Spanish:\n0.04 - 0.06+ Euro/word\n\nFrench\n0.06+\nGerman\n0.06 - 0.08+\nScandinavian\n0.08 - 0.12+\nCzech, Polish\n0.04 - 0.06\nRussian, Uzbek etc.\n0.03 - 0.05\nHungarian\n0.05 - 0.07\nChinese/Asian\n0.04 - 0.05+\nAfrican\ncan be quite pricey and we do not have enough translators\n(or work) in these languages yet to offer accurate information on this.\nA seasoned translator can generally translate at least\n2,500 words a day, to give you an idea how much you could earn at these rates.\nI also received many offers which were lower, but the\nquality of their translation samples was generally undesirable \u2013 quite possibly\nfrom non-natives living in less expensive countries and who could afford to\ncharge such rates. Then again, some customers only require an \u201cinformative\u201d\ntranslation and the lower rates suit them.\nFor a particular language combinationyou may look at what\nother translators are charging according to how they filled in our translator\napplication form (we have more than 12,000 translators in our database). You are\nwelcome to add your own rate, but your details will not be added to our\ntranslator database. Note that rates charged to direct customers are\ngenerally higher than fees charged to translation companies. The % is a wild\ncard, so chin% would yield both \"chinese mandarin\" and \"chinese traditional\".\nHere are a few links of other websites posting recommended translator charges:\nProZ\nTranslators Cafe\nTranslators Base\nShare|\nHowever, from my experience, these appear to be rates\ncharged by translators who have an existing and well developed client base, or\ntheir \u201chopeful\u201d rates. What one writes on their CV or portfolio may differ from\nwhat they are willing to accept when bidding on an actual project.\nFor example, Translator Caf\u00e9\u2019s posted rates for Czech to\nEnglish translations are as follows:\nshowing an average of 0.08 USD/word charged by translators\nliving in the Czech Republic. On a local level though, I know it is very\ndifficult to get more than 250 Kc per target page, which works out to about 0.06\nUSD per source word. Local companies rarely pay more than this, and often less. I\u2019ve also applied to many tenders on ProZ and experimented with different\nprices, and anything over 0.06 is generally ignored. This is what Proz's statistics show for Czech to English rates:\nWhat is the best part of translating?\nTrend in Translation Prices\nIn short, the story goes as follows (as drawn\nfrom www.commonsenseadvisory.com): \nSo, with the internet opening up markets, increasing competition in some language combinations while increased trade with other countries is increasing demand for their languages, prices have become dynamic indeed.\nPossible Strategies When Deciding on What Translation Prices to Charge\npretend you are a potential customer, approach several\ntranslation companies and ask them what they would charge for a particular\ndocument. Companies will generally charge between 0.01 and 0.06 Euro/USD per\nword, possibly more, in addition to what the translator charges.\nbefore filling out many application forms you might want\nto phone around to a few translation companies and ask them what rate they\ngenerally offer their translators.\nwhen setting your price make a note somewhere that you\ncan be flexible with your fee, depending on the project particulars.\nwhen offering a price to a direct customer, consider what\ncompanies charge and offer something slightly less, but more than what the\ncompanies generally offer their translators.\nwhen bidding on tenders, scatter your prices and\nexperiment. If one customer accepts your higher offer, you are not bound to take\nwork from another offer where you submitted a lower price. With such\nexperimentation you can develop a \u201cfeel\u201d for the market.\nbefore submitting a price on a particular project, make\nsure that you understand the conditions (due date etc.) and take a good look at\nthe text. Try to translate some parts, at least in your head. If it is very\ndifficult for you and will take you longer to translate, you should raise your\nprice accordingly. On the other hand, rather than squeeze yourself out of the\nmarket, you may consider accepting a more competitive rate and use the\nopportunity to practice and research the field. Over time you will be able to\ntranslate faster, and during which you could have built up useful translation\nmemory and glossary terms. At least this way you will secure for yourself a\nsteadier supply of work, you could eventually be considered an expert and start\nraising your prices.\nif the deadline is short for the volume and you will have\nto work hard and long hours to meet the schedule, you should generally charge\nmore. But keep in mind that you are also earning more by translating the higher\nvolume over a shorter period of time, and your competition might be willing to\naccept their standard rate. Again, it is good to be vague with your pricing. You\ncan try a higher price, but if you need the work, you can mention words like\n\u201cflexible\u201d and \u201cI would liketo\ncharge\u201d.\nif you are receiving repeat and regular work from a\nsatisfied customer, you might consider asking them for a price increase. But\nalways be polite, as an offended customer is easily a lost customer, and winning\ncustomers in the first place can be a lengthy and time-consuming process.\nif you are getting more work than you can handle and from\ndifferent sources, this is the perfect time to increase your translation fee to\nnew customers. To convince potential new customers of your high quality\nservices, beef up your CV and website with testimonies from your existing\ncustomers, and translation samples from your more difficult projects.\nFollow-up: What to Do After Submitting Your Translation Price, Rate or Fee\nIf it is an important or large project, it is good to send\nyour offer from at least two sources/email addresses, to make sure your\npotential translation customer receives your application (because of spam\nfilters etc). If you do not hear back from them you can write in a few days to\nfurther express your interest. But keep in mind that such large and potentially\nlucrative projects can receive applications from many translators, and that the\nproject managers could be swamped trying to process them all. But by expressing\nyour keen interest you are revealing your enthusiasm, which is important, as\nwell as your potential to decrease your price, if that is an issue.\nOnce your potential client expresses interest in your\napplication they will often ask you to jump through some hoops, such as to\nprovide a free translation sample, references or other tedious and non-paying\nwork. If you have not done so already now is a good time to check out the\ncompany\u2019s\npayment reputation. If the company has a good reputation. If the company has a good reputation it is quite possible it could lead to\nlots of future work, in which case it is worthwhile to do the necessary prep\nwork. But make sure to do it properly, because any shortcomings could cast a\npoor impression. If you did not fill in their application form correctly, or you\nleft mistakes in your translation sample, they will think you will be lenient\nand that there could be many problems if they did decide to send you some work. For this you might like to read up on our translation project bidding\nsuggestions [..\nTo make yourself look better in the eyes of enquiring\ncustomers, you might also consider obtaining certification from one or more\nsources. Get tested and prove your abilities. If you provided good quality to\nother customers in the past, try to get a reference from them. If you\naccomplished some difficult translations and you are not dishonouring a\nnon-disclosure agreement, consider posting to your online profile some samples\nof your previous work. You are not only competing in price, so make sure you\nlook good to your potential client.\nIt\u2019s a competitive industry, but there\u2019s also a lot of work\nto be had, since the industry generally grows by 20% each year (relating to a\nglobalizing world and increased trade between countries). There are also many\nbenefits of working in the comfort of your home. Therefore, think sharp and good\nluck!\nShare|\nIf you have any suggestions or commentswe\u2019d love to hear\nback from you!\n[Jul 3, 2016] Wow what a through explanation,\nI was waiting for this article as I was very much confused about my translation rates to be asked from a client. Thanks you cleared much. I am an Indian Translator and got an offer from an Indian English writer to translate his best selling book into Hindi. Gave my rates though, what you think would be the rate for\nEnglish to Hindi translation of a 225 page book?\nAccording to the above database query, 94\ntranslators had submitted their rates for English to Hindi, the average working\nout to 0.061/w. But for a book I would usually offer a discount, and depends on\nhow difficult the translation is and the deadline. If you have more time for the\ntranslation, you can take on other work and use the big project as a filler, in\nwhich case you can offer more of a discount. Always turns out a bit of a dance\nand play with the customer when trying to set a final price. Make sure you get\npaid in installments as you make partial deliveries, unless you completely trust\nthe customer.\nKENAX Translation Services- Quality service at a competitive price\n| Contact\nThe previous text for this page (the updated version is above)\nThis could be a difficult subject for a translation agency\nto post, as the translator will always want to receive the most for their hard work, and\nthe translation agency always pay the least, so that it could win the most tenders. Basically it is a bidding war. Any agency, or even individual translator, can post their\nservice on the internet, where files and even payments can be effortlessly transferred as\nif the end client and translator were located in the same city. In fact, we have mediated\nwork where both the translator and the customer were located near to each other, without\neven knowing, while on the other side of the world from us.\nThis becomes the age old problem of determining what a translator or agency can charge or\nget away with. Companies have been battling this question since time immemorial and for\nthis reason corporate spying and espionage exist. It is always a great temptation to learn\nwhat the other translators on a particular tender are charging, and we try to offer this\ninformation to our translators if they ask.\nHistorically, there are several types of bidding processes. The bidding\nmay be open, so that everyone knows what the highest bid is. The bidding may start at some\nbasement price. Other times the bidding is closed, meaning the bidders have to guess, in\nwhich case they might end up paying substantially more than the second highest bidder.\nFor translations, the matter is made further complicated because the bidding is not on the\nsame product, meaning that the quality and speed offered by the individual translators\noften differs.\nSometimes a customer may require only an informative\ntranslation, not requiring great quality, nor even a translation by a native speaker. Hence the bidding \"war\" includes non-native speakers in lower cost countries.\nOther times the customer may demand a very high quality translation, to include a\nproofread by a quality translator, the subject matter can be very technical and require an\nexpert, and the customer may be willing to pay for this quality.\nOther times the customer may require something very quickly and is forced to pay whatever\nit takes to get the job done on time.\nThe way we like to work is to charge a low flat rate on top of whatever\nthe translator charges. With our global system of\ntranslation servicesand our project managers located on different time zones, we have\nmanaged to reduce our overhead to enable us to charge this low surcharge on top of\nwhatever the translator charges. This enables us to win more tenders, whereby we might end\nup using the same translator as any other agency, increase our volume, in turn reducing\nour markup further, to win more tenders and increase our volume further.\nSo no matter how much the translator charges or the customer agrees to pay, our markup\nwill always remain the same (although we may charge more for first time customers to cover\nthe risk of non-payment).\nIt may seem unethical for us to disclose what the other translators are\ncharging, as such opening up the table to a bidding war so to speak, but enough of our\ntranslators have asked for this information in the past, which is why we have decided to\nmake this information public (shown below).\nKeep in mind that these prices are a general guideline of the average charged by quality\ntranslators and do not necessarily represent some ceiling for us or what we hope to pay. Sometimes we get very large projects which need to be accomplished in very short periods,\nand for which we often resort to much more expensive translators, just to get the job done\non time. In these cases we would add up the total charge for the entire project, divide it\nby the number of words translated to calculate a per word price what it cost us, perhaps\noffer some discount to the customer because of the overall size of the project, and then\nround the figure to some nice sounding price, issuing an invoice to the customer based on\nthat.\nMost of our customers trust us and accept our strategy, and most of the time our estimate\nat the beginning of a project is very accurate. Other times the customer may demand a\nconcrete price in writing, in which case we would be forced to guess on the higher end, to\nprotect ourselves against the unforeseeable. This is just the usual issues of running any\nbusiness.\nFor each project we always ask the translator what they\nwould like to charge, and move forward from there. Perhaps a lot needs to be done over a\nholiday, or the subject matter is very technical. We never force our translator to agree\non a permanently defined price and they are always entitled to change their price at any\nmoment. Based on a preliminary response from our translators, we can then issue a price\nestimate to the customer, and if we win the tender based on that, then we can proceed from\nthere.\nFrom the perspective of the translator, perhaps they might be free at the moment and be\nglad to work full time on a project for a month, offering us a discount, which we could\nthen pass onto the client to help us all win the tender.\nOther times the translator can be busy with other work, charge something\nmore because of the headache of having to go into overtime, and we might accept the higher\nprice because the situation demands it and the customer's budget can afford it.\nOr other times the translator may have developed a good name for themselves, with steady\nclients sending them subject matters they are comfortable with. Such a translator is in an\nexcellent position, and can afford to charge a higher price to new clients. Heck, such a\ntranslator can even begin to farm out projects to other quality translators, control their\nwork, charge their own markup rate, increase their volume, and eventually begin to operate\nlike an agency. This is the wonderful power afforded by the internet. I myself translated\nfor 8 years and during which time I slowly migrated to operating only an agency. In fact,\nI still translate from time to time, although I much more enjoy project management and\ncompany development.\nMy suggestion is to always seek new customers when you do not have paying\nwork. If you want to develop an agency while most of your earnings comes from your own\ntranslation work, you can work on that on your own free time. When looking for new\ncustomers, you can spend your time approaching a list of translation agencieslike ours (or for a small fee have us do this\nfor you), or filling in their translator applicationforms, or provide them with free translation\nsamples. All this takes an investment of time. In the beginning you might offer a more\nattractive rate just to secure yourself with enough work, but over time, as you build up a\nreputation for yourself and steady clients with a steady stream of work, you can start to\ncharge more to new clients, or approach your existing customers and ask if they might\noffer you more, considering how reliable you have been for them all these years.\nYou might consider a premium rate for express work or on translations which need to be\naccomplished over the weekend or holidays. You may devise different rates for different\nsubjects or volumes. Everything is possible, and every business does this. Just think\nabout the airline industry, which charges premium rates for the business class who need a\nflight on short notice, while offering much cheaper rates for tickets bought well in\nadvance, or even lower rates for student or standby tickets. Which are tickets sold only\nwhen some seats remain available and just before takeoff. In economics and business\nlanguage this is called price discrimination, which in some ways can be considered illegal\nor unethical, but practiced nevertheless. For this purpose very complicated software\nprograms have been developed for the airline industry, estimating which seasons will be\nbusier, and formulating a complex price grid, all designed to maximize profits for the\nairline company by charging different prices to different people.\nSo you can certainly try your own price discrimination, although I do not think there is\nany software developed like this for the translation industry. You might approach a few\ntranslation agencies (by pretending you are a potential customer) and see what they charge\nfor your language combination and expertise, in turn charging them an appropriate price.\nWhen charging a direct customer as opposed to a\ntranslation agency, you might try charging something in between what an agency charges and\nwhat you would normally charge an agency. If you establish a good name with direct\nclients, there is no reason why you couldn't charge as much or more than the agency if you\nare really good or are knowledged in a special area, which your customer needs.\nWhen submitting your price to a new client, you can also be vague and try\nsomething on the higher end. You can say \"Some of my existing customers pay me\",\nor \"If possible\", and include \"price negotiable\", for example. You\nobviously want as much as possible, but you do not want to scare away your new potential\nclient either, so if you are quoting high, do not make it seem like your price is firm and\nset in stone - unless of course you are so well established you do not need to look for\nother customers. In such a case you are ideally established, and you might consider\nscreening your own translators and quality control their work, so that you can offer a\nhigher capacity.\nPrices often vary among language combinations precisely because of the\ncosts of living in those countries.\nTypically, translations in Scandinavian languages will cost a lot more than, for example,\nHindu or Russian translations. This has nothing to do with the quality of the respective\ntranslators but everything to do with the costs of living of the countries where these\nlanguages are mostly spoken. Of course, it may happen that a Swedish translator has\ndecided to move to Beijing China, has chosen to charge three times the local Beijing rate\nfor his translations from German and English into Swedish, is quite well off at those\nrates considering the cost of living in China, while offering a rate which is less than\nhalf what the average Swedish translator is forced to charge because they live in\nStockholm. So such a China based Swedish translator can benefit from lots of work and live\nquite well. This again is the strength (or for some, the annoyance) that the internet\noffers, but such is the fact of life in this increasingly global marketplace.\nThis is why you should consider the prices we have posted below as a very\nrough guideline. They are based on the prices of quality translators we have found. This\nis not to say that we have not found less expensive translators, like the quality Swedish\ntranslator living in China, but we have chosen not to post these \"extremes\" but\nrather just the average. There are also many translators who charge more than this, but at\nthe below prices we have not found it difficult to find quality translators.\nPossible Guideline to Help You Set your Prices\nAfter a debate on ProZ, I modified the below data and aspire to achieve some \"wiki consensus\".\nI will break up the prices according to the following. For those who are only just considering to start a career in translations, an average seasoned translator can translate between 2500 and 5000 words a day.\n1) Your Local Rates\nAsk your local translation agencies what they offer.\n2) According to Projects I have Managed in the Past (table above)\nThese generally reflect the lowest price levels offered by my quality native translators. It should also reflect the local prices for those countries, quite possibly on the higher end. It could be a good price suggestion for someone who would like to work on the global web translation market.\n3) ProZ's and Translator Caf\u00e9's Posted Rates\nProZ's rate data is only available for full paid members, but TC's is open to free members. Taking Czech to English translationsas an example (because I have many years and active experience in this language combination), TC's rates show the following:\nFrom my experience these definitely do not reflect local prices in the Czech Republic (TC's are significantly higher), so perhaps consider these as aspired prices. Or what would apply if you live in Western Europe. The translation market is a very competitive place so it's good to do some research and see what options are best for you. Or combine approaches and see where that leads to.\n4) According to Applicants in our Database\nThis tableis drawn from our own database of applicants, while removing the extremes (above 30 and below 1 cent a word). It is raw data only and the quality of the translators has not been verified. We get about 4 applicants a day, from all over the world.\nYou may add your own rate and I will continue to develop this as interest in it increases. The averages script timed out before it could make the complex calculations, so unfortunately it did not include all the language combinations (stopped at Portuguese to Turkish). I will try to resolve this later to include all the language combinations.\nOther Websites to Help you Choose your Translation Rates\nProZ\nTranslators Cafe\nTranslators Base\nShare|\nImportant Translator or Translation Rates, Charges, Prices and Fee Links\nTranslation Payments Reputation- before you\ntake on a translation project from a new client you should check out what other\ntranslators have said about their payment practices and if they are a reliable payer.\nGetting\nPaid for Translation Work- once you have translated for them but are finding\ndifficulties getting paid, read what a couple of international lawyers have said about\nextracting payment.\nTranslation\nTips- to help you do a good job translating, which will bring you repeated\ntranslation work and increase your chances of getting paid.\nTranslation Resources- links to various translator resources to help\nyou with your work.\nTranslation\nJobs- many forums and resources to help you find translation work.\nTranslation\nAgencies- or approach the agencies directly by email without hunting down their\naddresses on the net.\nTranslator Application- come join our growing team!", "docid": "msmarco_doc_00_89242"}

Since it is based upon the Hebrew verb \u201c hayah \u2013 to exist,\u201d it answers mankind\u2019s most basic question: is there a god?\n\u201c Yada\u2019 means \u201cto know in a relational sense, to recognize, to acknowledge,\u201d and to use what you learn \u201cto understand.\u201d Therefore, the stated goal of Yada Yah is to come to know Yahowah as He revealed Himself to us.\nSince we have broached the topic, and since there is considerable confusion over this issue, recognize that \u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cbelieving\u201d are not the same thing. In actuality one is a substitute for the other. Those who do not know believe. Faith fills the void when evidence and reason are insufficient for understanding. So let\u2019s be clear: if you read this book, and if you are willing to dispense with your faith, you will come to know Yahowah. That is a promise.\nAs a surprise to many, God actually proves His existence well beyond any reasonable doubt \u2013 using prophecy. And in the process, He proves that He authored the testimony we are going to consider. He did this in the best possible way \u2013 at least considering that His prime objective is for us to choose to get to know Him and then to elect to develop a personal, family-oriented relationship with Him. This goal necessitates the auspices of freewill. And that means that God cannot make the choice to ignore Him impossible, which any other form of proof of His existence and inspiration would do.\nSo how, you may be wondering, did Yahowah conclusively demonstrate that He authored the testimony known as the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms? How did He prove that His witness can be trusted? The answer to both questions is prophecy. And that is why this book of books will focus on God\u2019s predictive statements.\nBy accurately reporting in our past what would happen in our future, and by committing these very specific prognostications to writing centuries prior to their fulfillment, Yahowah demonstrated that He is unconstrained by time. As is the case with light, Yahowah sees the past, present, and future as if they were all here and now. So since He has already witnessed that which has yet to occur in the ordinary flow of time, God isn\u2019t so much predicting what might happen, but He is instead reporting on what He has already witnessed.\nWhat that means to us is that if Yahowah got so much as one very specific and highly improbable prophecy right, we\u2019d be foolish to ignore what He had to say. But rather than one prediction, He has committed many hundreds, if not a thousand, of these to writing \u2013 many of which were memorialized in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Even a relatively small sampling of these often detailed and usually highly-unlikely predictions reveals that their chance fulfillment is less than winning a million-to-one lottery grand prize with a single ticket ten times in a row. Taken collectively, the odds of lucky guesses as opposed to absolute knowledge underpinning the prophecies in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms is more akin to playing a thousand, million-to-one lottery jackpots in a row, and never once failing to win. Yahowah is so confident regarding His predictions He says that we are free to reject Him should we find a single error.\nSo while we will focus on God\u2019s predictive testimony, do not assume that prophecy will completely monopolize our time. I say that because with every prediction Yahowah teaches us something important, often profound. And since these instructions are coming from God, the guidance He is providing along with them is vastly more important than the fact He reliably foretells our future. In reality, the only reason for God to prove His existence and authorship is so that we come to trust His testimony \u2013 a message which is devoted to explaining the conditions associated with His Covenant. In no uncertain terms, Yahowah will tells us who He is, what He wants, and what He is willing to offer us in return for our affection.\nThese things known, please do not assume that this is a religious book. It isn\u2019t. The God of the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms (errantly known as the \u201cOld Testament\u201d) is anti-religious. His animosity toward Judaism, Christianity, and Islam is extreme and unambiguous. More than anything man has conceived, God hates religion most of all \u2013 every religion without exception. Walking away from these corrupt human institutions is in fact the lone prerequisite for participating in the Covenant relationship. This is perhaps the greatest of all ironies.\nAs an interesting aside, if you are an agnostic, God\u2019s complete disassociation from religion may eliminate most of your objections to Him. The idiocy is religious, not Scriptural. In fact, most of those who have benefited from the testimony which is set out before you were formerly agnostics. It is much easier for them to examine evidence logically than it is for those plagued by religious beliefs. And ultimately, the case Yahowah makes is rationally irrefutable.\nWhile this book is not about me, you are entitled to know that I am both irrelevant and unqualified. My role is simply to serve as your guide. I had nothing to do with the sights you will be witnessing.\nI am not part of any organization. I do not accept donations. And I have striven to be as anonymous as possible. At best I\u2019m a flawed implement, a dented, dull, and misshapen tool.\nI say these things because I do not want you to trust me or to rely upon me. Instead, I want you to verify everything you find in these pages for yourself. While God can be trusted, no man is worthy of such esteem.\nAs proof that I am fallible, this is the eighth rewrite of Re\u2019shyth and the seventh overall of Yada Yah. The last time I tried to edit this Prologue, an entirely new book emerged entitled An Introduction to God. Even now, I\u2019d prefer that you read it than this. That is because An Introduction to God is foundational. The book which grew out of this one presents the seven things you need to know and understand to form a relationship with Yahowah and to be saved by Him. These include knowing and understanding Yahowah\u2019s Word, His Name, His Teaching, His Covenant, His Terms, His Invitations, and His Way.\nThe purpose of An Introduction to God is to establish a proper foundation from which to embark on your quest to know and relate to Yahowah. In it you are given the tools and the perspective required to observe Yahowah\u2019s testimony on your own. In that book, the unique nuances of Hebrew, the language of revelation, are revealed. You will discover why there is no past, present, or future tense in Hebrew. You will learn that most Hebrew verbs feature a relational stem and are written in a volitional mood. This means that a relationship is being developed between the subject and object of each discussion and that the message being conveyed is subject to freewill. But since the Introduction to God review of these things is comprehensive, there is no reason to replicate what is accomplished there in this book. So my advice is: please read An Introduction to God before you continue with Yada Yah.\nThat is not to say that we won\u2019t cover some of the same ground. That is unavoidable. And so in Yada Yah you will discover a wealth of information which is not revealed in the Introduction to God \u2013 just as there is an overwhelming amount of pertinent material presented in the Introduction to God which isn\u2019t duplicated in Yada Yah. For example, the first volume of Yada Yah is devoted to Creation, to the Garden of Eden, to the Flood, and then to Abraham\u2019s life \u2013 topics which are sparingly discussed in the Introduction to God. The only common ground between these books in this case is the Covenant.\nBy contrast, the Introduction to God contains but a subset of the information presented in the second and fourth volumes of Yada Yah \u2013 one of which focuses on the Seven Invitations Yahowah has provided for us to meet with Him while the other details God\u2019s prophetic portrait of exactly how He has gone about enabling His plan of salvation. In this way the Invitations and Salvation Volumes of Yada Yah became the more abbreviated Invitation and Way Volumes of An Introduction to God.\nIn this vein, the Good News Volume of Yada Yah details how the Ma\u2019aseyah Yahowsha fulfilled the first four Mow\u2019ed Miqra\u2019ey, describing how He has become the literal embodiment of the Towrah in the process. This backward-looking perspective isn\u2019t part of An Introduction to God because what occurred is much more accurately predicted in the Hebrew Scriptures than it is chronicled in the Greek eyewitness accounts. Also, those who focus on Yahowsha\u2019 seldom find Yahowah. And coming to know and embrace Yahowah is the only reason Yahowsha\u2019 exists.\nAlso unique to Yada Yah, less than one percent of the Going Astray Volume is replicated in An Introduction to God. It features a comparison between Howsha\u2019 / Hosea\u2019s Israel and today\u2019s troubled world. And in it we discover something very few people have considered: the overwhelming preponderance of human souls simply cease to exist and do not go to either heaven or hell.\nThe most significant omission in An Introduction to God is that it lacks a focused and comprehensive review of what constitutes Babel, known as Babylon. While you will find ample evidence that God hates religion, and that \u201c babel \u2013 corruption\u201d is the method behind Satan\u2019s madness, there is far more to learn about the reasons why Yahowah asks us to walk away from human religious schemes than is presented there. So while several hundred anti-religious and anti-political statements are scrutinized in An Introduction to God, I have yet to comprehensively demonstrate that Babylon is universally symbolic of the means Satan has used to beguile humankind. But at least that effort has a genesis in the God Damn Religion Volume of Yada Yah. Over time, it will be further developed therein.\nThat means that Yada Yah is still a work in process. The most riveting volume has yet to be written. Someday I hope to present most everything which can be known about the Last Days on earth. Witnessing the fulfillment of Yahowah\u2019s prophetic testimony before our very eyes is riveting, reassuring, and motivating.\nWhen that mission is complete, my goal will be to provide you with a rendering of Yahowsha\u2019s Words Only as they were memorialized in the books attributed to Mattanyah and Yahowchanan \u2013 the only eyewitness whose testimony can be trusted. And even then, we will have just begun. There is always more to learn.\nSo now you know: in Yada Yah we will begin where God began, by examining what occurred during the formation of our world. By carefully observing God\u2019s Towrah testimony we will come to better appreciate the prophetic, spiritual, and scientific implications associated with the creation of the universe and life within it. And by so doing, we will prove that there are no material disparities between science and Scripture. From there we will consider life in the Garden of Eden, even locate the Garden geographically. Here our focus will be on the prophetic implications of life with God and how we will one day very soon return to where we began. Also as it relates to the Protective Enclosure of Great Joy, we will consider why Satan was allowed into the Garden, and then consider how he corrupted Yahowah\u2019s testimony once inside, because once you come to understand what occurred then and there, you will appreciate how most every popular religion has gone astray. Moving on, we will turn our attention to the flood, also pondering its implications from a prophetic, spiritual, and scientific perspective. This will then lead us to the heart of the Towrah \u2013 to Abram who became Abraham \u2013 and to the formation of the Covenant.\nIn the third book of Yahowah\u2019s \u201c Towrah \u2013 Instructions,\u201d fittingly named \u201c Qara\u2019 \u2013 Invitations to be Called-Out and Meet with God,\u201d Yah presents His Mow\u2019ed Miqra\u2019ey, or \u201cScheduled Appointments to Meet\u201d with Him. An anathema and enigma to the faithful adherents of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Secular Humanism, these seven \u201c mow\u2019ed \u2013 scheduled appointments\u201d with Yahowah, serve as the one and only, the narrow, unpopular, and restrictive, way to be \u201c miqra\u2019 \u2013 invited to become called-out and encounter\u201d God. It is this path which the Ma\u2019aseyah Yahowsha\u2019 (our Redeemer\u2019s correct title and name, meaning \u201cImplement Doing the Word of Yahowah\u201d and \u201cYahowah Saves\u201d (corrupted by religious clerics to \u201cChrist Jesus\u201d)) followed. It is the way we must come to understand, to trust and rely upon, if we choose to participate in the \u201c beryth \u2013 covenant relationship\u201d with our Heavenly Father. There is no other path to Heaven, no other means to salvation.\nAnd so we will devote an entire volume of Yada Yah to Yahowah\u2019s \u201c Mow\u2019ed Miqra\u2019ey \u2013 Invitations to be Called Out and Meet with God.\u201d By carefully observing them, we will become privy to God\u2019s most sweeping prophecies relative to our salvation. Specifically, we will analyze what really happened during the three most important days in human history\u2014Passover, Unleavened Bread, and FirstFruits in 33 CE. We will discuss who the Ma\u2019aseyah Yahowsha\u2019 really is (the diminished corporeal manifestation of Yahowah set apart from Him to do the work required to save us), and who He is not (the Lord Jesus Christ). We will contemplate what He did (by observing, fulfilling, and enabling the Torah\u2019s promises), and what He did not do (die on a cross to save us). We will detail every material aspect of the seven-step path Yahowah provided to enable us to live forever in His home as part of His family.\nAs a surprise to many, the means to meet with God and to be saved by Him, are presented in the Towrah \u2013 and nowhere else. So that is why in the second volume of Yada Yah, after considering the terms and conditions of the Covenant, we will contemplate every conceivable nuance of Yahowah\u2019s seven Invitations. You will learn how to observe His Festival Feasts, and in so doing come to understand God\u2019s plan of salvation.\nThe book of Hosea (actually Howsha\u2019, meaning \u201cSalvation\u201d) is pivotal in the lives of God\u2019s chosen people. So we will examine it from beginning to end. In the process we will learn the consequence of rejecting the Towrah and its Covenant. And we will also find God\u2019s promise to reconcile His relationship with Yisra\u2019el.\nThe means to reconciliation is the focus of the Salvation Volume of Yada Yah. But here, rather than examining the work and words of the Ma\u2019aseyah from the perspective of the Greek historical texts, we will instead come to understand what He did and said by reading Yahowah\u2019s prophetic, albeit eyewitness, accounts of what occurred in Yaruwshalaim in Year 4000 Yah (33 CE). As a result, you will experience the method and means behind the most extraordinary offer ever made. It will be as if you were there, and better, because unlike the actual eyewitnesses you will have a copy of Yahowah\u2019s plan, and thereby know exactly what happened and why it had to occur that way. And as a result, you will discover that God did not die, there was no cross, there was no resurrection (at least not bodily), and that what occurred on the most important of the three days is completely unknown to Christians. The actual story is far more magnificent.\nThat is not to say that we won\u2019t analyze the Greek text, but only that the Christian New Testament is not inspired, and thus is not nearly as enlightening or insightful. For the most part, it isn\u2019t even accurate. And yet by devoting the fifth volume of Yada Yah to the Good News associated with Yahowah honoring His Towrah promises, we will find a wealth of reassuring affirmations. The very testimony Christians find confusing will make complete sense. For example, have you ever wondered why Yahowsha\u2019 said that His upcoming sacrifice could be equated to Yownah\u2019s (meaning Yah\u2019s Dove/Spirit, but corrupted to Jonah\u2019s) ordeal over the course of three full days and three full nights when the eyewitnesses seem to speak of events which began on Friday afternoon and conclude before sunrise on Sunday? And have you ever wondered why Yahowsha\u2019 asked, \u201cMy God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?\u201d How does God die? If it was Yahowsha\u2019s body which rose from the dead, why didn\u2019t anyone recognize Him? Or more troubling still, since Christianity is predicated upon its \u201cNew Testament\u201d replacing the \u201cOld Testament,\u201d why did Yahowsha\u2019 say that the Towrah would never be annulled? These are the very questions God, Himself, answers.\nBut that is not to say that Christians will find God\u2019s answers acceptable. They will reject them outright, preferring Paul\u2019s testimony instead. And that is why the sixth volume of Yada Yah is called God Damn Religion. In it, we will consider the adversarial role of Babylon, and more specifically babel, from the beginning of recorded history to the final prophetic comment issued by God. And as a shock to the souls of Christians, especially Roman Catholics, they represent Babylon in today\u2019s world. Of the \u201cChurch,\u201d Yahowsha\u2019 says in His prophetic Revelation letters that they are the seat of Satan, married to Satan, and are dead as a result. God will even tell us that He does not hear the prayers of those who do not observe His Towrah.\nShould you be able to endure this level of detail, should you be willing to invest the time required to examine all the connections and associations God has made, contemplating the symbols and metaphors which permeate His every thought, you will come to \u201c yada\u2019 \u2013 know\u201d Yahowah. Should you be able to open your mind, to alter your perspective, and change your thinking, you will come to know God as He revealed Himself. What\u2019s more, you will be properly prepared to capitalize upon Yahowah\u2019s Covenant Relationship, including the plan of salvation which makes it possible.\nThis progression of things, of coming to know Yahowah first, capitalizing upon His Covenant Relationship second, and then relying upon His plan of salvation, is one of many things Christians get wrong. They never come to know God as He revealed Himself in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms. Their religion focuses instead on a diminished subset of God, and on what one has to believe to be saved.\nLong after God introduces Himself, in the first book of the Torah, \u201c Bare\u2019syth \u2013 In the Beginning,\u201d He explains the nature of the \u201c beryth \u2013 family-oriented covenant relationship\u201d He wants to develop with us. And as part of those \u201c Towrah \u2013 Instructions,\u201d Yahowah describes what is required of us to participate in this relationship. And that is why most of the Introduction to God is devoted to the Towrah and its Covenant. It is why I implore you to read it if you have not already done so. Understanding the process of Creation is fascinating, as is coming to know the what, when, where, and why of the Garden of Eden and the Flood. But this all pales in comparison to understanding the Yah\u2019s Towrah Teaching, especially as it pertains to the Covenant.\nAs a direct result of reading the Introduction to God, you will discover the surprising prerequisite, and the four requirements associated with this relationship, in addition to an amazing array of benefits. Coming to understand and embrace these things is so vital to the health and survival of your soul I would encourage those of you who have not yet read the Introduction to God to do so at this time.\nAs we turn the pages of the Towrah we find Yahowah not only explaining His name, but also revealing how He wants us to view Him, and how He wants us to live our lives, scribing His perspective in stone. Therefore in both books we will carefully examine the words Yahowah personally etched on those two tablets. So unless you are already a student of the Towrah, I dare say you will be shocked by how different God\u2019s revelation is from man\u2019s popular renditions of the \u201cTen Commandments.\u201d\nSo while these books are complementary, you\u2019d be better served to read An Introduction to God prior to Yada Yah so that you become more familiar with the basics. I want you to more fully appreciate the uncommon and surprising nature of Hebrew grammar. I\u2019d like you to be aware of the textual history surrounding Yahowah\u2019s Word. It is important that you come to realize that there is a proper way to pronounce Yahowah\u2019s and Yahowsha\u2019s Name. But most of all, since the Towrah is the introduction to God, nothing is more important than you coming to understand how and why Yahowah wants you to observe His Teaching and Guidance \u2013 which is the very definition of Towrah.\nGod wants you to know that the primary purpose of the Towrah is to direct your attention to the terms and conditions of His Covenant so that you choose to participate. He wants you to know and understand each of the five things you must do if you want to engage in a relationship with Him. Equally relevant, it is Yahowah\u2019s hope that you come to appreciate the reality that salvation is a byproduct of the Covenant, and thus is not His primary objective.\nAs we embark on this journey we will scrutinize the terminology Yahowah revealed under a microscope, amplifying His every word, so that we learn as much as possible. During our voyage through words and time, the overall portrait God has painted will be brilliantly illuminated.\nAs I have mentioned, we will focus on prophecy because precise predictions which consistently materialize as they were written serve as the means Yahowah uses to prove that we can trust the words He spoke in His Torah, Prophets, and Psalms. God not only proves His existence, He proves beyond any reasonable doubt that He inspired His testimony. He did so because He wants us to know Him, to choose to engage in a relationship with Him, and to understand the path He has provided home to the point we are capable of trusting it and relying upon Him.\nAnd yet with all of this before us, finding God in the Torah is so contrary to the teachings of the Jewish, Christian, and Islamic religions, most will simply reject this possibility, choosing instead to cling to the misguided tenets of their faith. For the religious, God\u2019s Word remains insufficient to free them from their beliefs. In fact, the onslaught of irrefutable evidence and unassailable logic which God provides continues to be squandered on those beguiled by man\u2019s religious schemes. Jews disregard Moseh\u2019s (Moses\u2019) eye-opening proclamations in favor of their Talmud\u2019s mind-numbing rabbinical arguments. Christians disregard Yahowsha\u2019s (errantly known as \u201cJesus\u2019\u201d) \u201cSermon on the Mount\u201d in favor of Paul\u2019s hopelessly conflicting epistles. And Muslims disregard the fact that Muhammad\u2019s Qur\u2019an is the antithesis of Yahowah\u2019s Torah, even though Allah\u2019s most basic claim is that his book confirms that which it consistently contradicts. Sadly, most of those seeking God will be precluded from finding Him by their faith.\nA thorough investigation of the evidence pertaining to mankind\u2019s presence in the universe, and to an accurate understanding of God, leads to an inescapable conclusion: the Scripture Yahowah inspired\u2014His Torah, Prophets, and Psalms\u2014remains the world\u2019s only rational candidate for divine inspiration. Now, I don\u2019t expect you to concur with me, or Him, in this regard, seeing as you are reading the ninth page of a three-thousand-page volume of book, but I have no doubt that, somewhere along this journey, those of you who are intellectually honest will render a similar verdict. Frankly, the case Yahowah makes on behalf of His revelation is so compelling; I\u2019m amazed most people continue to stumble in the dark.\nBy reading Yada Yah you are going to find that much of what you have been led to believe isn\u2019t true. Religious founders, clerics, and politicians have deceived you to empower and enrich themselves\u2014most knowingly, many purposefully. It isn\u2019t that everything they say is a lie; it\u2019s that so many lies have been blended with the truth that what\u2019s left is more poisonous than beneficial. And there is nothing more beguiling, more destructive, or more deadly than half-truths\u2014deceptions which have been crafted to seem plausible. Well-crafted counterfeits fool even those who are not foolish because while they are actually worthless, they appear genuine.\nSo that you might clean your mental slate, and be properly prepared for what you are about to read, understand that it is absolutely impossible for the religions of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or Mormonism to be reliable. Each claim that the \u201cBible\u201d is the inspired word of God, and each draw their authority from it. And yet all of these religions conceal, change, convolute, contradict, criticize, curtail, and counterfeit the very testimony they claim was inspired. Therefore, if Yahowah\u2019s testimony is true, they are false based solely upon their variations from God\u2019s revelation. But if Yahowah\u2019s testimony is untrustworthy, then they are unreliable as well, because these religions claim to represent what would then be an unreliable deity\u2014a reality which undermines their authority and credibility. It is thus impossible to be an informed and rational Catholic, Christian, Muslim, Mormon, or religious Jew. For this reason, it is foolish to trust these human religious schemes\u2014no matter how they make you feel or how popular they have become.\nIf what Yahowah says is true, there is only one God, He has but one name, and there is only one path to Him. If what Yahowah says is true, nothing is more important than knowing what He revealed. Therefore, accurately presenting God\u2019s Towrah testimony is the primary purpose of Yada Yah.\nThe verdict you will ultimately be able to render on what is true and what is not, on what leads to life or to death, will soon be based upon considerably more accurate information than has been made available to you previously. Together, we are going to scrutinize the oldest Hebrew manuscripts of Yahowah\u2019s Towrah, Prophets, and Psalms and consider the earliest Greek witnesses of Yahowsha\u2019s (once again, \u201cJesus\u2019\u201d actual name meaning \u201cYahowah Saves\u201d) testimony. I will translate and amplify God\u2019s revelations for you using the best scholastic tools. (More on this in a moment.)\nAs we journey down this road, we will discover what God wants us to know about His nature, our purpose, and His plans, even His timeline. And in the process of closely examining His revelation, we will uncover something profound, perhaps even surprising: Yahowah wants us to enjoy an engaged yet relaxed, personal, conversational, upright, and familial relationship with Him. He wants to adopt us. God doesn\u2019t want us to fear Him, to bow down to Him, or even to worship Him. He despises religions\u2014all of them. He adores relationships and will sacrifice everything (save His integrity) to achieve them.\nNow for a word of warning: Yada Yah, like An Introduction to God, is a book comprised of long books. It is more detailed, better documented, and more insightful, than most anything you have ever read. God is much smarter than we are, and His writing style is brilliant. Every detail is included for a reason, and most every passage communicates on several levels simultaneously. God\u2019s every word is a story in itself. Collectively they serve to explain the who, what, where, when, and how of the relationship our Heavenly Father seeks to develop with each of us. Exacerbating this intellectual challenge, most Yahowah has to say is so contrary to many of the things you have been taught, most will have to spend as much time unlearning as they do learning, especially those who want to know God as He revealed Himself to us.\nTo appreciate how everything relates to the ongoing story of our purpose and of our redemption, to understand how the provision Yahowah has delineated leads to the establishment of an eternal family, will require considerable time and an open mind. Your willingness in this regard could well determine the fate of your soul, in addition to those you love. To form a relationship with God, to be saved by Him, you will first have to change your perspective, your attitude, and your thinking. And that my friends will be difficult, if not impossible, for those of you who consider yourselves religious.\nFor most, especially Christians, faith has become synonymous with religion, and belief is all that matters. And yet with God, these things are irrelevant, even counterproductive, because faith is nothing more than belief in the unknown. And belief is simply a religious substitute for evidence.\nIn opposition to faith and belief, Yahowah wants to be known, to be understood, to be trusted, and to be relied upon. This is the reason He encourages us to closely and carefully observe His Torah. It is why He revealed it and filled it with prophetic proclamations.\nWhile Yada Yah is among the best-researched and most-accurate presentations of Yahowah\u2019s Word, and while the many unique insights contained within it are especially relevant and revealing, it is but a pale reflection of God\u2019s testimony. So, since my best efforts to till the depths of God\u2019s Word seldom reach much below the surface, at the very least, I owe it to you and to God, to share as much of His revelation as I am capable of understanding. And while that is admittedly a pittance compared to what is actually there, it is the least I can do.\nYet in spite of my deficiencies, the richness of Yahowah\u2019s Word is more than sufficient for you to know God, to appreciate the benefits of His Covenant, and to rely upon His plan of salvation. That is, so long as you are willing to open your mind, so long as you are willing to walk away from religious and political affiliations, and so long as you are willing to invest the time.\nThe evidence affirms that Yahowah\u2019s Word was as inerrant as words allow when it was revealed in Ancient Hebrew to Moseh and to the Children of Yisra\u2019el. But God makes no claim that your human translation is inerrant because He knows that it is impossible. While language is mankind\u2019s most important tool, it is an imprecise one\u2014especially apart from Hebrew, the language God, Himself, authored. Further, no language translates perfectly from one dialect to another. And while these are issues with which we will grapple, the biggest problem with translations is that there is often very little correlation between the text of the oldest manuscripts and what is printed on the pages of the most popular \u201cBibles.\u201d As a rough rule of thumb, at least with regard to the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, I have found that the oldest manuscripts (those found in Qumran dating from the first, second, and third centuries BCE and first century CE) differ from the more recent ones that serve as the basis of our translations (the oldest Masoretic Text dates to the 11 th century CE) by one word in five\u2014especially considering the variances in vocalizations. In places where they agree, another one word in five is errantly conveyed, and yet another one in five is so inadequately presented the full meaning is lost. In other words, only fifty percent of what you read is reliable.\nBy way of example, you may be surprised to learn that God told us His name\u2014Yahowah\u2014exactly 7,000 times in His Covenant Scriptures. That is an average of seven times per page when His message is formatted in a standard fashion. But on each occurrence, religious men elected to copyedit the Author, replacing His name with a title of their own choosing\u2014one associated with Lord/Ba\u2019al, better known as Satan.\nBut that\u2019s comparatively good news. The oldest extant manuscripts from Yahowsha\u2019s Disciples, the Greek codices dating to the first- through third-century CE, differ so substantially from one another, and so overwhelmingly from the more complete fourth-century manuscripts like the codex Sinaiticus, that there is no hope of accurately reconstructing the preponderance of what is errantly known as the \u201cChristian New Testament.\u201d Philip Comfort, the world\u2019s leading authority on this subject, wrote the following indictment in his \u201cIntroduction\u201d to the Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts: \u201cThis book provides transcriptions of sixty-nine of the earliest New Testament manuscripts. All of the manuscripts are dated from the early second century to the beginning of the fourth (A.D. 100 \u2013 300). We chose A.D. 300 as our terminus da quem because New Testament manuscript production changed radically after the persecution under Diocletian (A.D. 303 \u2013 305) and especially after Constantine declared Christianity to be a legal religion in the empire.\u201d\nBeyond this unpopular reality, we must also deal with Paul\u2019s credibility, and the veracity of his letters, in our quest to understand what is and is not trustworthy. (Again, should you not concur with my assessment of Paul, feel free to jump ahead in time and consider the recently completed first volume of Questioning Paul, called The Great Galatians Debate. In it, Paul\u2019s letters are compared to God\u2019s Word, so that you will be equipped to make an informed decision.)\nWith regard to the Greek texts known as \u201cMatthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, First and Second John and Peter, James, and Revelation, virtually all \u201cbible\u201d translations either corrupt or change most names and titles, including all of the most important ones. And yet, none of the seven names or titles attributed to Divinity (errantly rendered as: Lord, Jesus, Christ, God, Father, Spirit, or Son) were written out on any page of any of the pre-Constantine Greek manuscripts. Placeholders were uniformly used to tell us where to insert: Yahowah (God\u2019s one and only name), Yahowsha\u2019 (meaning Yah Saves), Ma\u2019aseyah (which means \u201cImplement Doing Yah\u2019s Work\u201d), and Set-Apart Spirit (from Ruwach Qodesh ). There are two reasons that these Divine Placeholders were universally presented on every codex written by Yahowsha\u2019s Disciples dating to the first- through third-century. Names like Yahowah and Yahowsha\u2019 cannot be transliterated using the Greek alphabet. And God\u2019s titles are meaningful in the original language\u2014where the words themselves convey important instructions.\nCorrectly designating the proper names and titles God chose shouldn\u2019t have been difficult since He and His human messengers told us where to look for answers: the Torah, Prophets and Psalms. But sadly, religious men and women have conspired to hide the evidence contained therein. Further exacerbating this problem, most Christians have been misled by Paul into believing that their religion serves as the replacement for the Torah\u2019s teachings, not recognizing that there is only one Covenant.\nEvery name and title Yahowah chose to reveal conveys essential truths, and yet these messages are routinely ignored. \u201cJesus\u201d is actually Yahowsha\u2019. In Hebrew it means \u201cYah Saves.\u201d The name \u201cJesus\u201d was conceived by men. It is recent in its origin, erroneous, and meaningless etymologically. Yahowsha\u2019 tells us that Yahowah manifest Himself in the form of a man, and that in this corporeal fashion, He Himself saved us. Yahowsha\u2019 defines the Ma\u2019aseyah\u2019s identity and describes His mission. Whereas \u201cJesus\u201d was named after \u201cGesus,\u201d sometimes transliterated \u201cHesus,\u201d the savior of the Druid religion where the \u201cHorned One\u201d is god. (For those seeking a more in-depth analysis of Yahowsha\u2019s name, as well as the etymology of man\u2019s errant moniker for Him, these subjects are not only covered in future Yada Yah chapters, these topic are discussed in depth in the Name Volume of An Introduction to God .)\n\u201cJew\u201d is actually Yahuwdy, and means \u201crelated to Yah.\u201d \u201cIsrael\u201d is really Yisra\u2019el, which means \u201cindividuals who engage and endure with God.\u201d \u201cIsaiah,\u201d the most prolific of the prophets, is Yasha\u2019yah; which can be translated: \u201cSalvation is from Yah.\u201d \u201cJohn\u201d both the Apostle and the Immerser, is Yahowchanan; which tells us that \u201cYah is Merciful.\u201d And on and on it goes, with a lost lesson encapsulated in every name. In fact, as we shall discover, there are 260 names and titles like Ma\u2019aseyah and Yahowsha\u2019, which are based on Yahowah\u2019s name and found throughout the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms. Collectively these affirm aspects of God\u2019s character and purpose no less than ten thousand times.\nThe same is true with many of the words Yahowah selected. Men have changed them. \u201cHoly\u201d is actually from qodesh, meaning \u201cset apart and cleansing.\u201d It is one of Scripture\u2019s most oft repeated and revealing concepts\u2014one applied to the Ma\u2019aseyah, to the Spirit, to the Sabbath, to the Temple, to the Ark of the Covenant, to the Seven Called-Out Assembly Meetings which facilitate our salvation, and of course, to those who are saved.\nIn this vein, \u201cChurch\u201d is a corruption of ekklesia, meaning \u201ccalled-out assembly.\u201d It is the Greek equivalent of miqra\u2019, the title Yahowah chose to describe His seven annual appointments with humankind. And therein lies an essential truth.\n\u201cCross,\u201d is a corruption of stauros, meaning \u201cupright pole.\u201d Its root is histemi, the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew quwm, meaning \u201cto stand up so as to enable others to stand, establishing them and raising them up.\u201d And interestingly, stauros was never written out in the text of any pre-Constantine Greek manuscript. It is represented by a Divine Placeholder, signifying that the \u201cUpright One\u201d and the \u201cUpright Pillar\u201d which serve as the \u201cDoorway to Heaven\u201d represent God. This now hidden truth serves as the foundation of the Word and the Way.\n\u201cAngel\u201d is derived from transliterating aggelos, meaning \u201cmessenger,\u201d rather than translating the Greek term. \u201cGospel,\u201d however, is without basis. The revealed term is euangelion, a compound of eu, meaning \u201chealing and beneficial\u201d and aggelos, \u201cmessage and messenger.\u201d\nThe concept of an \u201cOld\u201d and a \u201cNew Testament\u201d was derived from Marcion, an anti-Semitic Christian who shaped and promoted the new religion Paul had conceived. According to Yahowah, there is but one \u201cCovenant,\u201d one which He will \u201crenew\u201d upon His return. Moreover, the term \u201ccovenant,\u201d is from beryth, which speaks of \u201ca family-oriented relationship.\u201d I say that because beryth is based upon beyth, meaning \u201cfamily and home,\u201d further defining the kind of relationship Yahowah is interested in establishing.\nThe simple truth is: God did not replace Judaism with Christianity, Jews with Gentiles, nor Israel with the Church. He has consistently described and facilitated the relationship He originally established with Abraham and developed through Moseh.\nYada Yah does not claim that every obfuscation of truth was purposeful, yet each publisher\u2019s reluctance to correct their \u201cbibles\u201d serves as an indictment against them. Moreover, at times the comparison between the oldest manuscripts and today\u2019s revisions will leave us with no alternative but to assume that the Christian copyedits were purposeful. And since these deceptions have been willfully and knowingly advanced by pastors and priests, clerics are complicit in the corruption\u2014coconspirators if you will. Hopefully, this realization will lead you to the place Yahowah wants you to be\u2014trusting Him and not men.\nAt their best, translations are a compromise between attempts at word-for-word literalism and loose thought-for-thought interpolations. Either way, much of the intended message is lost or misrepresented for the sake of readability, brevity, or familiarity. So we will dig for truth the hard way. We\u2019re going to work for it. The key words in most passages will be amplified from the original languages. Amplification is a process whereby many words are used to properly convey the full meaning and nuances of the original term as it was known and used in its time, context, and culture. If a Hebrew word requires a paragraph to adequately communicate its meaning, you will find the required background, etymology, and shadings. In other words, we are going to scratch well below the surface. This will require you to read most passages several times to fully appreciate what Yahowah is saying.\nWhen it comes to translations, my goal is to accurately communicate the totality of the message Yahowah intended. But that does not necessarily make the translations literal for the following reasons. First, like most ancient languages, there was no capitalization or punctuation in Ancient Hebrew. Therefore, the moment we apply English grammar rules we begin making accommodations and assumptions.\nSecond, conjunctions (and, but, so, yet, nor, or, for) in Hebrew are usually attached to a noun or verb, as opposed to being rendered independently. This is also the case with articles (a, an, the), prepositions (in, by, with, of, on, to, from) and pronouns (I, me, we, us, you, she, he, they, them). But in English, we will have to separate all of these into individual figures of speech.\nIn this regard, you\u2019ll notice that the transliterated sound of each Hebrew word set within the parenthetical was written without reference to conjunctions, articles, prepositions, or pronouns. Had I not done this, you would not have been able to verify the meaning of the Hebrew words for yourself. While you can look up qara\u2019 or dabar in any Hebrew lexicon, you will not find the prefixed and suffixed forms, such as wyqara\u2019 or wydabar.\nThe reason that I\u2019ve taken the time to convey the Hebrew basis of each sentence is because verification is an essential component of discovery. Questioning leads to understanding. So by presenting the Hebrew for your consideration your search for answers is facilitated. (On this topic, you will find that I routinely demonstrate the source of the vowel sounds in words composed by using the Hebrew letters Aleph ( \u05d0) and Aiyn ( \u05e2) by way of apostrophes.)\nThis brings us to a third challenge: completeness. Let\u2019s consider qara\u2019, for example. It forms the basis of Miqra\u2019 (the plural being Miqra\u2019ey ), and is most often translated \u201ccalled out,\u201d but it also means \u201cto summon, to invite, to recite, and to read.\u201d Even more than this, qara\u2019 speaks of \u201cbeing welcomed into someone\u2019s company and meeting with them.\u201d Therefore, depending upon the context, qara\u2019 could be rendered many different ways, most of which might apply. And in an amplified translation I will consistently err on the side of too much information rather than too little.\nThe fourth challenge to providing an accurate and complete translation is symbolism. For example, \u2018ohel is the Hebrew word for \u201ctent.\u201d But if this is all you read, you would miss the fact that \u2018ohel is also a \u201ccovering, a home, a shelter, and a protected place suited for living.\u201d And these symbolic implications are just the beginning. \u2018Ohel is based upon, and in the text is written identically to, \u2018ahal, which means \u201cto shine brightly, clearly reflecting light.\u201d\nSo, like so many Hebrew concepts, there are both physical and spiritual dimensions associated with the word. Therefore, rather than depicting a nondescript \u201ctent,\u201d the \u2018ohel / \u2018ahal often represent a \u201cprotective enclosure of radiant light,\u201d a \u201cshining shelter,\u201d a \u201ccovering which is conducive to life,\u201d and a \u201chome\u201d which is associated with Yahowah Himself by way of His Covenant. As such, this \u201cradiant shelter\u201d is symbolic of the Set-Apart Spirit\u2019s Garment of Light which makes us appear perfect in God\u2019s eyes, enabling us to enter His presence and camp out with Him on the Miqra\u2019 of Sukah \u2013 Shelters.\nThis leads us to the fifth challenge, where we are compelled to consider every reasonable vocalization of each word. The diacritic markings, or vowel points in the Masoretic Text, are the product of Rabbinical interpretation. This was highlighted by our discussion of \u2018ohel versus \u2018ahal, where the meanings were different, albeit complementary. In that vocalization influences most every word in the text, it is important that you realize that the Rabbinical choices were often reasonable, but at times arbitrary, and sometimes purposefully misleading.\nWhile we are on the subject of vocalization, there is but one non-negotiable rule in a field of approximations where variant means to phonetically convey foreign words are all considered valid. Names and titles must always be transliterated (replicating the sound in the new alphabet) while words must always be translated (conveying the meaning in the new language). The pronunciation of names of the Pharaoh Ramses, Genghis Khan, Der Fuehrer Adolf Hitler, and Islamic Jihadist Osama bin Laden do not change from one language to another. Similarly, the name and title Ma\u2019aseyah Yahowsha\u2019 should never be altered, much less substituted for something of man\u2019s choosing.\nSixth, word order in Hebrew is less significant than it is in English, and is often reversed. Rather than write \u201cYahowah\u2019s Torah,\u201d or \u201cSet-Apart Spirit,\u201d the text reads \u201c towrah yahowah \u201d and \u201c ruwach qodesh .\u201d Further, verbs don\u2019t always sit in the middle of the action, as is required in English, between subject and object. So in the transition from Hebrew to English, one cannot slavishly follow the word order of the original language.\nOur seventh challenge to a proper translation is a surprise to most everyone. Ancient and Paleo-Hebrew exist as an aspectual language, meaning that the same form of a verb can be translated as past, present, or future. Hebrew tenses are inclusive with regard to time. So while we can often deduce the proper tense based upon the context of a discussion, the realization that the message itself was not limited to a certain period of time, makes everything God revealed applicable for everyone throughout time. Yahowah\u2019s Word, like Yahowah Himself, is always true, regardless of time or place.\nThe eighth challenge to providing a complete and accurate translation lies in determining when enough is enough. The more completely each word is defined, the more nuances and shadings which are conveyed, the more difficult each sentence becomes to read and comprehend. After a while, it all becomes information overload. So, when the number of relevant insights exceeds our ability to process them within the context of a sentence, and still retain the flow and substance of each discussion, we will color Yah\u2019s linguistic palette in subsequent paragraphs. Further, recognizing the difficulty of processing such an enormous amount of new information, I will endeavor to introduce Scriptural passages in such a way that you are grounded within the relevant context.\nIn this regard, while the floodgates of understanding are opened by the unique nature of Hebrew stems, conjugations, and moods, there is no succinct way to communicate their contribution. A stem can necessitate a literal interpretation or might demonstrate a causal relationship. A conjunction can be used to reveal the continuous and unfolding nature of something, or just the opposite, that something has been completely accomplished. And the moods all convey volition, which is to say that they express a desire which is subject to choice. So while these ideas are all germane to our relationship with God, they cannot be expressed in English as fluently as they are conveyed in Hebrew. But to ignore them, as most every English bible translation does, is to shortchange the message.\nThe ninth consideration is also surprising. Many of the best lexicons were published by the very institutions which have brought us such horribly errant translations. And while lexicons, interlinears, and dictionaries bearing titles such as the New American Standard Hebrew-Aramaic and Greek Dictionaries and The ESV English-Hebrew Reverse Interlinear Old Testament often provide the best window into the etymology of the Hebrew words themselves, if their definitions are correct, their translations are not.\nAlong these lines, a dependence on one, or even two lexicons, dictionaries, or interlinears will produce unreliable results, as they are individually filled with errors. Strong\u2019s Lexicon is a valuable tool, especially in helping to identify word roots, but yet it exists in large part to justify the King James. Many hundreds of their definitions were religiously inspired, and are not the result of scholastic etymology. The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon uses Arabic to define Hebrew terms, not recognizing that written Hebrew existed 2,500 years before the first Arabic word was penned. And the Gesenius Hebrew-Chaldee Lexicon to the Old Testament is filled with theological opinions, most of which are invalid. Moreover, every Hebrew lexicon and interlinear is synced with the Masoretic Text and their vocalizations, which are wrong nearly twenty percent of the time.\nThe tenth challenge is unlike the others. An accurate translation of Yahowah\u2019s testimony is so radically different from what is found in popular English Bibles (all of which profess to be \u201cthe word of God\u201d), the Introduction to God and Yada Yah translations will be hard for many people to accept. How is it, some will ask, that an individual without professed qualifications could be right, and every other translation be wrong?\nThe answer is typically: motivation. The more English Bibles differ from what Christians have become comfortable hearing, the harder they are to sell. So, rather than losing money publishing new translations of the oldest manuscripts, the NKJV, NASB, NIV, and NLT provide modest revisions of their own previous translations which were simply stylistic interpretations of the King James Version, which was a revision five times over of a translation of the Latin Vulgate, which was itself an amalgamation of Old Latin texts based upon the Greek Septuagint, a highly unreliable translation of the original Hebrew text. And with each subsequent translation, from Hebrew to Greek to Latin to English, the message became confused and corrupted, and ever the more distanced from the original. Then, from this point forward, all subsequent translations became nothing more than financially-inspired revisions. Specifically, the King James Version was a modest modification of the Bishop Bible, which was a revision of the Great Bible, which amended the Cloverdale Bible, which was a revision of John Wycliffe\u2019s translation of the Latin Vulgate, which was a blend of Old Latin texts, which were translations of the Greek Septuagint, which was a translation of the Hebrew text.\nThe bottom line in marketing, and especially publishing religious texts, is familiarity sells. As a result, every popular modern Bible translation is similar to every other popular Bible translation, because had they not been similar, they would not have become popular. So their similarity shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Bible translations are all style over substance. And their authors have no compunction against changing God\u2019s testimony to suit their faith.\nMany have sought to dismiss the translations found in Yada Yah with an uninformed: \u201cI can\u2019t believe God would allow His Bible to be corrupted.\u201d They are saying, in essence, that the translation they prefer is perfect. And yet to hold this view, one enormously popular throughout Christendom, a person has to ignore an ocean of irrefutable evidence to the contrary. Moreover, God, Himself, told us that men would pervert His testimony. He even revealed the consequence of such corruptions. But, even if you choose not to believe Him, as is the case for most Christians, what about the evidence?\nWell, for this religious myth to be plausible, there could be no divergent parchments among the 215 Scriptural manuscripts found in the cliffs above Qumran, collectively known as the Dead Sea Scrolls (dating from 250 BCE to 68 CE). And yet the small differences we find among them are magnified exponentially by the time these texts reemerge under the auspices of the Masoretic Text. Septuagint copies (dating from the 2 nd -century BCE to the 5 th -century CE) differ so wildly that in the 3 rd -century CE, Origen, one of the few early theologians to study Hebrew, was compelled to dedicate most of his life to resolving the conflicts between them, creating his Hexapla (which unfortunately has been lost to time). If God had intervened to keep His Scriptures from being corrupted, both the Septuagint and the Masoretic Text (dating to the 11 th -century CE) would have mirrored the Dead Sea Scrolls, and yet this is not what the evidence reveals. These texts differ by as much as twenty percent.\nTurning to the Greek texts, the situation only gets worse\u2014much worse\u2014which is catastrophic to the Christian myth of \u201cGodly protection\u201d and \u201cinerrancy.\u201d The sixty-nine pre-Constantine codices which have now been unearthed differ substantially among themselves. This variance then becomes irresolvable as these first- through third-century textual witnesses are compared to those scribed in the wake of Catholicism\u2019s emergence in fourth-century with their remarkably divergent Codex Sinaiticus and Vaticanus. And yet the biggest discrepancy of all exists between these manuscripts and the Textus Receptus \u2014which was acclaimed as being \u201cwithout error\u201d by the religious community in the 16 th -century. However, the known disagreements between it and the older codices have now been shown to exceed 300,000 in an 182,000-word text. Further, for the \u201calways accurate\u201d myth to be valid, the Textus Receptus would have had to have been word for word identical to the more scholarly and modern textual blend known as the Nestle Aland, but they differ almost as much as they agree. And these inconsistencies still don\u2019t take into consideration a myriad of religious copyedits or countless invalid translation choices.\nSo for you Christians who are still murmuring: \u201cI can\u2019t believe God would allow anyone to corrupt His message,\u201d for your faith to be grounded in something remotely credible, at some point you will have to deal with the fact that the Masoretic differs significantly from the text found in the one-thousand-two-hundred-year-older Dead Sea Scrolls. You will have to account for the fact that the 16 th -century Textus Receptus and the 20 th -century Nestle Aland differ materially, and both are overwhelmingly divergent from the now extant first- through third-century manuscripts of the text they purport to present. So, if your current \u201cBible\u201d is accurate by happenstance of fate, it means that every prior witness to the text was inaccurate. As a result, the question now becomes: was the Christian God unable or unwilling to protect His message from human corruption, because the notion that \u201cGod would not allow anyone to corrupt His message\u201d requires complete ignorance of the textual evidence to the contrary. It requires faith in that which is not true, completely undermining the value of religious belief.\nThen we must face the issue of Roman Catholicism, and Jerome\u2019s Latin Vulgate, which served as the only \u201cbible\u201d for most of the world for over one thousand years. As a blend of divergent Old Latin manuscripts which were free translations of wildly divergent copies of the Septuagint, which were themselves imprecise translations of the Hebrew text, the Vulgate is predictably in substantial conflict with the five-centuries-older Qumran parchments. But yet inexplicitly, it is eerily similar to today\u2019s most popular English translations, which casts a dark shadow on their validity. Equally damaging, for over one thousand years, no one outside of Roman Catholic clerics could read the official Latin text, effectively preventing any layperson from knowing God\u2019s Word, even if it had been preserved without corruption. The Roman Catholic Church, by way of their marriage of cleric and king, made it a crime punishable by death to own a translation of the Vulgate. And to make matters worse, in the rare case that someone would attempt a translation into a language which could be read and understood, as was the case with John Wycliffe in 1384, the perpetrator and their product were labeled heretical and burned.\nSimply stated: none of these variations or eventualities would have been possible if God had intervened and refused to allow His word to be corrupted by man. So since He obviously allowed it, isn\u2019t it incumbent upon us to not only come to understand why He did so, but also to strive to discover what He actually revealed?\nConsidering, therefore, the complexity of these many challenges, none of which are properly conveyed in other translations, we will not rely upon the Latin Vulgate, KJV, NKJV, ASB, NASB, IV, NIV, NLT, or any other popular Scriptural rendition. All English translations vary from poor to horrible. There isn\u2019t any worth recommending. Even those with the good sense to write God\u2019s names back into the text, do very little to correct the message Yahowah is revealing.\nIn that the biggest obstacle to knowing the truth about God is the inaccuracy of today\u2019s Bible translations, I\u2019d like to linger here a bit longer, even at the risk of being repetitive. The King James Bible is nothing more than a politically-inspired revision five times over of that text. The Geneva Bible, which had become popular at the time, used marginal notes to highlight passages which demonstrated that God had not anointed any king with the right to rule. Since this was contrary to the claims made by all kings, including King Iames (as he was known at the time), it became politically expedient to pen a new bible, whereby the marginal notes were removed, the translations tweaked to please the king, and Paul\u2019s letter to the Romans was recast in the thirteenth-chapter to reclaim the Divine Sanction. So Iames hired the era\u2019s most acclaimed secular humanist, Rosicrucian, and occultist, Sir Francis Bacon, to create a more accommodating rendition of Catholicism\u2019s Vulgate.\nUntil quite recently, the Textus Receptus was touted as the foundation of all English translations of the Greek text which is errantly known as \u201cthe Christian New Testament.\u201d And yet it was little more than an intellectual fraud and financial hoax. In October of 1515 CE, a Dutch secular humanist, Desiderius Erasmus, and Johann Froben, a publisher of low repute, took five months to mark up, adding and taking away from, a flawed 12 th -century Medieval Greek manuscript, and they set type directly from those arbitrary scribbles. Then in places where their manuscript was void, they filled in the blanks by translating portions of the Latin Vulgate back into Greek. Worse, when Roman Catholic clerics protested that some of their pet passages weren\u2019t included, to quiet their critics, Erasmus and Froben added them without any legitimate basis. Such an example is the story of \u201cJesus and the adulterous woman\u201d recounted in John (actually Yahowchanan, meaning Yahowah is Merciful) 8:1-11, whereby the \u201cone without sin\u201d was told \u201cto cast the first stone.\u201d This, the most famous and often quoted \u201cNew Testament\u201d abstract is false. It did not occur. The alleged discussion, which if true, would have Yahowsha\u2019 disavowing the Torah. But it is not found in any manuscript prior to the 8 th century CE. Similarly, you will not find the ending of Mark, chapter 16 verses 9-20, in any pre-Constantine manuscript, nor even in the 4 th -century Codex Sinaiticus or Vaticanus.\nBut in the absence of a viable competitor, Erasmus\u2019s and Froben\u2019s scholastic and financial fraud was said to be \u201ca text received by all in which we have nothing changed or corrupted.\u201d This myth was thus rendered: \u201cthe Textus Receptus .\u201d And while the evidence is overwhelming that the King James Bible, which was first printed in 1609, was actually a revision of prior English translations of the Latin Vulgate, its authors attributed their text to this very same and highly flawed Textus Receptus. The KJV then became so popular; no English translation has yet been offered which dares to correct its familiar phrasing, especially of the most memorable passages.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1707 that the Textus Receptus was challenged\u2014effectively undermining the basis of the Reformation and Protestantism. John Mill, a fellow of Queens College in Oxford, invested 30 years comparing the Textus Receptus to some one hundred much older Greek manuscripts. In so doing, he documented 30,000 variations between them. And even this was just a rash on a donkey\u2019s posterior. Known variations between the oldest manuscripts of the Greek text, and those which publishers now claim serve as the basis for their translations, may actually exceed 300,000.\nEven though some improvements were made in the later Westcott and Hort (1881) and Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament (1898 (also known as Novum Testamentum Graece )), both texts, while differing substantially from the Textus Receptus, remain more in sync with it than with the earliest extant (and recently discovered and published) Greek manuscripts from the first- through third-centuries CE. So while Christian pastors hold up their favorite English translation of their \u201cBible\u201d and proclaim that it is \u201cthe inerrant word of God,\u201d factually, the book they are touting isn\u2019t even remotely consistent with the earliest witnesses.\nSome of these same issues exist with the Hebrew text\u2014albeit to a lesser degree. All English Bible translations claim to be based upon the Masoretic, an 11 th century vocalization of Babylonian Hebrew (itself a pseudo-translation of Ancient and Paleo Hebrew) composed by politically- and religiously-minded, and very misguided, rabbis. Their copyedits of Yahowah\u2019s Word are now legend, revealed courtesy of the 3 rd -century BCE through 1 st -century CE, Dead Sea Scrolls. For example, in the Great Isaiah Scroll in which the entire text has been preserved, we find that the oldest witness from Qumran and the Masoretic Text differ by 14% with regard to the textual root of the words alone. To this we must add innumerable errant vocalizations which significantly alter the meanings of the words Yahowah selected.\nSo while God\u2019s words in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, and Yahowsha\u2019s words properly translated and accurately retained in the eyewitness accounts, were inspired, and while much of what they revealed has been preserved in old manuscripts and thus can be known, translations are strictly human affairs. As such, I do not claim that my Scriptural presentations are perfect, only that they are as accurate and complete as I can render them using the oldest manuscripts and best research tools.

It\u2019s a lot of information, so recognize that in the quest to be thorough and accurate, fluidity will suffer. Scripture will not roll off the tongue in familiar word patterns. But if you question, verify, and study the words Yahowah revealed, you will come to know the truth\u2014as God revealed it.\nAnd yet, this will not be easy. As I have already mentioned, there is a substantial difference between the definitions rendered in the lexicons which bear the names of popular bible translations, and the translations themselves. So if their word definitions are accurate, their translations are not. And in this way, serious students of God\u2019s Word quickly come to appreciate the Achilles\u2019 heel of their bible. If believers questioned the texts they were reading, if they did their homework, they would reject their bibles, their pastors, their church, and their religion.\nThat is not to say that we cannot know what God revealed. But it is to say that our quest to understand will not be easy. And that, surprisingly, is exactly as Yahowah wants it to be\u2014at least between now and His Yowm Kippurym return in 2033 \u2013 when He will write His Towrah inside of us. He wants all of us to value knowing Him sufficiently to prioritize this endeavor.\nAlong these lines, when Yahowah introduces a new term, one that seems to defy normal translation, we will study other verses to see how He initially deploys the concept. For example, the singular Hebrew noun zarow\u2019a, is usually translated as \u201carms,\u201d and yet Scripture suggests it means \u201csacrificial lamb.\u201d And at other times, we will find that a good translation just isn\u2019t possible. In that case the word will be transliterated in the text and then explained in subsequent paragraphs. Nesamah, whose best analog is \u201cconscience,\u201d is such a term, one we will examine at the end of the \u201c Chay \u2013 Life\u201d chapter.\nFor your benefit, the genitive case (scrubbed of pronouns and conjunctions) of the actual Hebrew words found in Scripture are italicized and set inside parentheses within the text itself. The most generic forms are provided so that you will be able to look them up in Hebrew lexicons. This is also done so that you might gradually become more familiar with God\u2019s most commonly used terms.\nIn this regard, understanding is based upon evidence and reason. And the best source of information, at least as it relates to the existence of God and the means to salvation, is a complete and accurate translation of God\u2019s testimony\u2014replete with a comprehensive evaluation of the words He selected to communicate to us. That is why this book is dedicated to Yahowah\u2019s predictions and instructions, not mine\u2014or anyone else\u2019s. This is a conversation with God, not with me. All I have attempted to do is provide a handrail, an augmentation, a running commentary, and a contextual framework for considering and connecting His insights so that they are as revealing as possible. Hopefully, this will encourage you to reflect upon the significance of His words.\nTo maintain a clear distinction between my observations and Yahowah\u2019s, Scripture is printed in a bold font. Yahweh\u2019s words (correctly translated) can be trusted. Mine are only there because I want you to think about His. I do not purport to have all the answers\u2014but fortunately I don\u2019t have to because He does, and He has told us where to find them. Revealing them, and where to find them, is the intent of His testimony and thus of this book.\nWhile my opinions are mostly irrelevant, I think that it\u2019s useful for you to know that I am of the conclusion that the Hebrew Scriptures were without error, so far as language makes that possible, as the inspired writers of the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms (everything from Bare\u2019syth / In the Beginning / Genesis through Malak / Messenger / Malachi) put quill to parchment two-thousand-five-hundred to three-thousand-five-hundred years ago. But as time passed, occasional scribal errors, a considerable onslaught of religious editing, and changes in language and customs, conspired to rob us of the message which originally permeated the divine texts. These problems were multiplied when the Hebrew manuscripts were translated into Greek, then Latin, en route to being rendered in English. And this issue was exacerbated by political and religious agendas\u2014all designed to make the flock easier to control and fleece.\nIn rendering Yahowah\u2019s Word in English as completely and accurately as possible, I have favored the preferred meanings of the Hebrew terms unless a different vocalization of the text or a secondary definition provides a better, more consistent fit considering the context. Etymological roots will be our principle guide as we explore. If a phrase still begs for elucidation, we\u2019ll consider colloquialism, and will always be attuned to metaphors and especially symbolism.\nHebrew provides a rich linguistic palette\u2014especially for subjects related to human nature and relationships, things Yahowah cares deeply about and about which He had a lot to say. And the language is spiritually revealing. It speaks to mind and soul.\nSome say that there may be a deeper, mystical meaning to passages, some esoteric code latent in Gematria and Equidistant Letter Sequences. While there may be merit to these claims, no matter what\u2019s buried under the words, their plain meaning, and the mental pictures they provide, is primarily what God intended for us to understand.\nSince words comprise the totality of Scripture, and thus prophecy, and since God calls Himself \u201cthe Word,\u201d it\u2019s important that we render His correctly. Words are Yahowah\u2019s most important symbols. His Scripture represents Him, His Word defines Him; it explains His purpose and plan. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Words are the basis of most everything: communication, thought, consciousness, relationships, and causality. It is even possible that a communication medium lies at the heart of what we consider matter and energy\u2014the very stuff of creation. We think in words. Without language, virtually nothing can be known and nothing happens. There are no meaningful relationships without words. Written language is considered man\u2019s greatest invention and our most important tool. So when it comes to the Word of God, we will examine His thoughts closely.\nAs mentioned previously, the reason I have chosen to focus on prophetic Scripture is because these passages provide assurance of divine inspiration. Foretelling the future is how God proves that He authored His Scriptures. Only a Spirit who exists beyond the constraints of time can know what will happen in the distant future. When events play out precisely as He said they would, historical reality demonstrates that what He revealed is trustworthy and true. Faith is replaced by logic, probability, and reason. For example, during this study, I have grown from believing God exists to yada\u2019 Yahowah\u2014to knowing Him. Hopefully you will too.\nProving that His Word is reliable, and thus worthy of our consideration, is one of three ways our Creator uses prophecy. He also uses it to reveal His nature, His plan, and His instructions. Most every prediction is designed to \u201c towrah \u2013 teach\u201d us something. That is why we will dissect fulfilled prophecies, not only to validate their veracity, but to better understand Yahowah\u2019s message. And then we will examine yet un fulfilled prophecy, not only to understand what lies in our future, but more importantly, so that we may be prepared to help others deal with what\u2019s coming. All along the way, we will analyze the profound lessons attached to God\u2019s prophetic proclamations so that more souls will: Yada Yah, and be inclined to enjoy an honest and open conversation with God.\nThe third purpose of divine prediction is to let us know how the whole story fits together from Adam to Armageddon, from the first family to the eternal one. Prophecy provides us with the skeleton upon which to flesh out the body of information Yahowah has given us regarding our redemption\u2014past, present, and future. There is virtually nothing of consequence that can be effectively understood without tying prediction to fulfillment, dress rehearsal to final enactment. The Covenant is affirmed by the Ma\u2019aseyah\u2019s fulfillments, just as the Towrah defines Yahowsha\u2019s purpose while explaining His words and deeds. It is all one unified message.\nTherefore, our principle textbook in this voyage of discovery will be Yahowah\u2019s Covenant Writings, augmented by the eyewitness accounts of Yahowsha\u2019s words and deeds. Outside sources will only be consulted when they are necessary to appreciate the historical or scientific implications of a passage.\nBeginning at the beginning, you will soon discover that Bare\u2019syth / In the Beginning / Genesis One lies at the intersection of prophecy, history, and science. It tells three stories in one, all designed to reveal God\u2019s purpose and plan. Yahweh\u2019s opening salvo provides the framework upon which all significant prophetic events are fulfilled. It is accurate scientifically, right down to the specifics, providing a precise accounting of the order things were manifest over the course of six days from the perspective of the Creator. It even provides us with an overview of mankind\u2019s history\u2014past, present, and future. More important still, each verse is laden with guidance, essential insights for continued and better living.\nIn this regard, Scripture itself quickly dispels the misconception that the earth is 6,000 years old\u2014a myth that is held by the majority of Christians. As a result, the debate between science and creation should never have existed. The first three chapters of Yada Yah demonstrate that both are correct. The universe is just shy of 15 billion years old and it took God exactly six days to create it.\nIt should be apparent that Yada Yah is not going to tickle your ears nor shy away from controversy to win friends and influence people. You will find its commentary as blunt as God\u2019s Word.\nIn fact, if one passage seems to contradict another, we will examine both without reservation. We will trust God to resolve the apparent inconsistency. When Yahowah says something that is contrary to established religious teaching, we will stop what we were doing long enough to evaluate a sufficient quantity of related passages to understand what is actually being revealed. And if what we find undermines the teachings and credibility of religious and political institutions, so be it. I do not belong to any organization, and I am not advocating for any human institution. My only concern is properly reporting what Yahowah has to say.\nWe are going to give God the credit He deserves. If He is providing multiple insights in a single account, we will examine all of them (at least as many of them as my feeble mind can grasp). When God decides to ascribe teaching to His predictions, as He most often does, we will contemplate His advice. When God broaches a new subject in a prediction, we are going to follow His lead and study related passages to better appreciate His prescriptions.\nThat leads us to another delightful challenge, one that has caused these volumes to expand in length and complexity. We will not rest until we understand the essential lessons of Scripture. Consider this example: a score of verses say that some souls, upon death, will experience eternal life in the company of God. Half that number say that some souls will end up in She\u2019owl, where they will experience perpetual anguish. Yet hundreds of passages reveal that most souls will simply cease to exist. That is to say, when they die their soul will dissipate to nothingness. How can this be?\nRabbis, priests, and imams all teach that there are only two eternal destinations: heaven or hell. Yet eternal anguish is a completely different result than death and destruction. Therefore, for Scripture to be trustworthy (and for God to be lovable), there must be three options\u2014eternal life with God, eternal separation from Him, and the option to fritter away one\u2019s soul, wastefully squandering it. This is one of many profound insights that you will find in these pages and perhaps nowhere else.\nThe same is true with the concept of worship. There are a score of verses which seem to suggest that God wants to be worshiped and hundreds that say otherwise\u2014that He wants us on our feet, not on our knees. The truth in this regard is essential to our understanding of the Covenant where we are asked to walk and talk with God\u2014to be upright with Him. This perspective lies at the heart of the debate between Yahowah wanting to enjoy a familial relationship with us as opposed to imposing a submissive religion.\nSimilarly, our translations tell us that God wants to be feared, and yet in Yasha\u2019yahuw / Salvation is from Yahowah / Isaiah, Yahowah states that \u201cthe fear of God is a manmade tradition.\u201d Moreover, one cannot love that which they fear.\nSome statements seem to say that we can\u2019t know the timing of things, such as the date Yahowah will return. Yet Scripture begins by detailing Yahowah\u2019s chronology and timeline, something Yahowsha\u2019s testimony in Revelation amplifies and affirms. If prophetic timing is unknowable, why did God provide a specific timeline and a thousand revealing clues?\nI suspect that my willingness to date Yahowah\u2019s prophetic fulfillments\u2014past, present, and future\u2014will be one of the most contentious aspects of Yada Yah. I\u2019m going to tell you exactly when God is going to fulfill His prophecies, because He told us. All I had to do was contemplate the Scriptural evidence and then connect the data. As for the warning \u201cno one knows the day,\u201d we\u2019ll examine the Olivet Discourse from many perspectives to conclusively demonstrate that God was not saying that we wouldn\u2019t be able to figure this out.\nAnother point of contention may arise because I am opposed to quoting or commenting on any verse out of context. So if you write me and ask how one verse or another fits within the universal truths contained in the whole, I\u2019ll tell you to read the book. The practice of referencing isolated phrases leads to false assumptions which in turn lead to incomplete and errant thinking. For example, if we want to understand why Yahowsha\u2019 spoke of His upcoming Passover sacrifice in the context of Yownah / Yahowah\u2019s Dove / Jonah\u2019s \u201cthree days and three nights in the belly of the whale\u201d (when the eyewitnesses say that Ma\u2019aseyah was only tormented two days and two nights), we will find ourselves reviewing the historic context of Yahowsha\u2019s discussion with the religious leaders which led to the comparison, and then we will find ourselves on board the ship with Yownah to see what really happened that stormy day. In the process, we will resolve the apparent contradiction, demystify the reference to the whale, learn a great deal about how God communicates with us, and come to appreciate the Creator\u2019s sense of humor.\nQuoting passages out of context is what led to the doctrines of heaven or hell, to the three persons of the Trinity, to replacement theology, to the impossible notion that the Ma\u2019aseyah is completely God and completely man, to the diminished relevance of the Torah, to Sunday worship, and to disputes over the timing and existence of the harvest of souls known to Christians as \u201cthe rapture.\u201d While an errant theological position can be supported with isolated verses, for a conclusion to be valid, no passage should be able to refute it.\nThere are a few more things you need to know at the outset. I\u2019m nobody special, at least among men. I\u2019m just a regular guy, albeit more passionate and flawed than most. Although I\u2019m not hard to find, you may have noticed that I haven\u2019t ascribed my name to this mission. My only qualification for compiling this witness to expose deception and proclaim the truth was my willingness to engage when Yahowah asked. If that is not sufficient for you, if you are more interested in the messenger than the message, if you are impressed with accomplishments and credentials, find a book written by someone in the religious or political establishment. Such authors will gladly exchange your money for a confirmation of what you have already been led to believe.\nSo now you know: these volumes are not religious. This message does not portend to be popular either. One of the more limiting factors in this regard will be the unfamiliar vocabulary promoted throughout this book. I avoid many of the terms you are accustomed to hearing, even though using them would attract a much larger audience. God does not combat deception with lies, nor shall I.\nTherefore, in the closing pages of the Prologue, I\u2019m going to share a truncated portion of the Name Volume of An Introduction to God to demonstrate why each of the following names, titles, and words are inappropriate: Lord, Jesus, Christ, Christian, Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Gospel, Grace, Church, and Cross. And in their place, I\u2019m going to refer to the same text to present Yahowah\u2019s preferences.\nThe reasons this must be done are many. It is vital that people have the opportunity to know that they have been deceived by those who have preyed upon their devotion. God wants us to stop trusting clerics so that we might choose to rely on Him. Therefore, providing readers with reasons to jettison their associations with political and religious institutions is consistent with Yahowah\u2019s instructions. Further, there is a lesson in every human deception and vital insights in every divine revelation.\nIn this light, I have often been accused of being overly zealous regarding terminology. But this is the only rational option available to us. If we see the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms as being from God, then its every word was inspired and chosen by Yahowah. Changing His words to suit us is then arrogant, misguided, and counterproductive.\nTherefore, throughout Yada Yah you will find Yahowah\u2019s name properly written, even though it may be unfamiliar to you, in each of the 7,000 places He cites it in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms. I will not use \u201cLORD\u201d in reference to God because \u201clord\u201d is synonymous with Ba\u2019al, which is Satan\u2019s title throughout Scripture. It describes the Adversary\u2019s ambition, which is to rule over God, to lord over men, and to control the messages pontificated by cleric and king, so that the masses submit to him. After all, the nature and ambitions of a lord are the antithesis of a father.\nGod\u2019s aversion to being called \u201cthe Lord\u201d is why Yahowah revealed that upon His return, on the Day of Reconciliations when the Covenant is finally renewed, He will never again tolerate its use. \u201cAnd it shall be ( hayah \u2013 will exist) in ( ba \u2013 at, with, and on) that ( ha huw\u2019 \u2013 or His) day ( yowm \u2013 speaking of His return on the Day of Reconciliations), prophetically declares ( ne\u2019um \u2013 predicts, reveals, and promises) Yahowah ( ), you shall refer to ( qara\u2019 \u2013 read and recite, summon and invite, and call out to) Me as an individual ( \u2018yshy \u2013 Me as a marriage partner and as Me as one who exists in your presence); and ( wa) shall not ( lo\u2019) call Me ( qara\u2019 \u2013 summon Me or read aloud) \u2018My Lord\u2019 ( ba\u2019aly \u2013 my Master, the one who owns and possesses me) ever again ( ly \u2018owd \u2013 now or forevermore). \ufeffFor I will remove ( suwr \u2013 reject, separating Myself from, and revolt against, renounce and repudiate) the Lords\u2019 ( Ba\u2019alym \u2013 the masters, owners, possessors, and false gods) names ( shem) out of ( min \u2013 from) her mouth ( peh \u2013 speaking of the lips and language of Yisra\u2019el), and ( wa) they shall not be remembered, recalled, or mentioned ( lo\u2019 zakar \u2013 proclaimed or be brought to mind) by ( ba) their name ( shem) ever again ( \u2018owd \u2013 any longer) .\ufeff\u201d (Howsha\u2019 / Salvation / Hosea 2:16-17 / 18-19)\ufeff\nBa\u2019al isn\u2019t the only Hebrew title for \u201cLord.\u201d There is another. It is \u2018adown ( \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05df ). But since the word was commonly used to describe ambitious and covetous men engaged in politics and religion, as well as merchants and military leaders who have schemed to \u201clord over\u201d the masses and be their \u201cmaster,\u201d the arrogant and oppressive human title was pointed to read \u2018adoni or \u2018adonay so that it could be used to replace Yahowah\u2019s name all seven thousand times YHWH appears in the Covenant Scriptures.\nBut there is more to the story than this. You see, the commonly contracted form \u05d0\u05d3\u05df in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, can be pointed to read \u2018eden ( \u05d0\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05df ), \u2018edon, or \u2018adon. These vocalizations describe an \u201cupright pillar rising up from an established foundation.\u201d It is used to depict the upright, strong, and reliable nature of Yahowsha\u2019s legs in the Song of Solomon 5:15. In Yowb / Job 38:6, \u2018eden is the \u201cfoundation\u201d upon which the \u201ccornerstone is laid,\u201d thereby serving as a reference to Yahowsha\u2019 being the cornerstone of Yahowah\u2019s Tabernacle. \u2018Eden, which is more accurately transliterated \u2018edon, emphasizes something which is \u201cfirm, strong, and solidly reliable,\u201d as in a \u201cwell designed and constructed foundation.\u201d As such \u2018eden / \u2018edon is used to portray the \u201cbase into which tent pegs were inserted to hold the upright pillar of the Tent of the Witness, whereby the structure, which is symbolic of Yahowah\u2019s home and of Divine protection, is enlarged and held erect by the upright pillar, which is symbolic of Yahowsha\u2019, whose work and words make it possible to enter into God\u2019s protective custody. You will find the Hebrew letters \u05d0\u05d3\u05df vocalized \u2018eden fifty-seven times in the Tanakh, with all but the two instances referenced above describing an aspect of the Tabernacle of the Witness\u2014and all in the Torah.\nOnce the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms are scrubbed of the most obvious Masoretic copyedits\u2014that of writing \u2018adownay above YHWH, or more accurately , some 6,873 times, you will find \u2018adownay on 434 occasions in the Masoretic Text. However, a comprehensive review of the Dead Sea Scrolls reveals 127 places where religious Rabbis simply erased Yahowah\u2019s name and scribed \u2018adownay in its place. Once these are removed, the context dictates that the first person singular suffixed variation of \u05d0\u05d3\u05df, which is \u05d9 \u05d0\u05d3\u05df, should have been vocalized \u2018edownay, and translated \u201cUpright Pillar,\u201d \u201cMy Upright One,\u201d or \u201cMy Foundation,\u201d all 307 times it applies to Yahowah.\nAs evidence that \u2018adown is descriptive of men, not God, it shares the same root as \u2018adam, the Hebrew word for \u201cman.\u201d Further, all 335 times \u2018adon appears in the Tanakh, it applies to politically or religiously empowered men, with two thirds of these translated \u201clord,\u201d and one third rendered \u201cmaster.\u201d Strong\u2019s defines \u2018adown and its contracted form \u2018adon, as \u201ca reference to men\u201d who are \u201cowners, strong lords, and masters.\u201d They suggest that it may be derived from an unused root meaning: \u201cto rule.\u201d As such, it also describes the Adversary\u2019s ambition: to be called Lord by men, to rule over them and to be their master, to control, intimidate, and overpower men\u2014to own their souls.\nTherefore, it is completely appropriate to attribute the Towrah\u2019s own definition of \u2018eden / \u2018edon to Yahowah. He is the \u201cUpright One,\u201d the \u201cFoundation,\u201d and the \u201cUpright Pillar of the Tabernacle.\u201d He stood up for us so that we could stand with Him. But, it is not appropriate to associate Satan\u2019s ambitions with God. Our Heavenly Father is not our \u201cLord.\u201d His Covenant is based upon an entirely different kind of relationship. Lord is inconsistent with both freewill and family.\nNow that God has affirmed that He does not like being referred to as the \u201cLord,\u201d and now that you understand why, let\u2019s consider His name, and whether we can and should pronounce it. The most telling passage in this regard is found in the book Yahowah entitled Shemowth \u2013 Names. You may know it as \u201cExodus.\u201d\n\u201cAnd ( wa) Moseh ( Moseh \u2013 the one who draws us away from human oppression and divine judgment) said ( \u2018amar) to God ( \u2018el), the Almighty ( ha \u2018elohym \u2013 the Mighty One), \u2018Now look, if ( hineh \u2013 behold, look here, and note if) I ( \u2018anky) go ( bow\u2019 \u2013 arrive and come) to ( \u2018el) the Children ( beny \u2013 sons) of Yisra\u2019el ( Yisra\u2019el \u2013 a compound of \u2018ysh \u2013 individuals, who sarah \u2013 strive and contend with, engage and endure with, are set free and are empowered by \u2018el \u2013 God), and I say ( wa \u2018amar) to them ( la), \u201cThe God ( \u2018elohym \u2013 the Almighty) of your fathers ( \u2018ab) has sent me out ( salah \u2013 has extended Himself to dispatch me) to you ( \u2018el), and they ask ( wa \u2018amar \u2013 question) me ( la), \u2018What is ( mah) His personal and proper name ( shem) ,\u2019 what ( mah) shall I say ( \u2018amar) to them ( \u2018el) ?\u201d\u2019\u201d ( Shemowth / Names / Exodus 3:13)\nWhile God would give Moseh a direct answer, He didn\u2019t do so directly. And that is because there is a bigger difference between Amen Ra, Amun, Aten, Horis, Seb, Isis, Osiris, Sobek, et al, and Yahowah, than just a name. Yahowah is for real. He actually exists. So by revealing the basis of His name first, Yahowah answered the most important question we can ask: yes, there really is a God. \u201cGod ( \u2018elohym) said ( \u2018amar \u2013 answered and promised) to ( \u2018el) Moseh, \u2018ehayah (\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d4\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b6 \u05d4) \u2018asher (\u05d0\u05b2 \u05e9\u05c1\u05b6 \u05e8) \u2018ehayah. (\u05d0\u05b6 \u05d4\u05b0 \u05d9\u05b6 \u05d4) \u2013 \u2018I Am Who I Am.\u2019\u201d ( Shemowth / Exodus 3:14) In His response, God conveyed: \u201cI Exist.\u201d \u201cI was, I am, and I always will be.\u201d \u201cI am exactly who I say I am.\u201d\n\u2018Ehayah is the first person singular of hayah, meaning: \u201cI exist, I am, I was, I will be.\u201d \u2018Asher denotes a \u201crelationship, an association, or linkage,\u201d and is often translated \u201cwith, who, which, what, where, or when.\u201d \u2018Asher is also a \u201cblessing.\u201d So by using these words, Yahowah told us: 1) He exists, 2) that our continued existence is predicated upon His blessing, 3) that relationships are of vital interest to Him, and 4) how to pronounce His name (Yahowah is based upon hayah ).\n\u201cAnd ( wa) He said ( \u2018amar), \u2018So this is what ( koh) you should actually say ( \u2018amar \u2013 answer (scribed in the qal relational stem, affirming the reliability of this advice, and in the imperfect conjugation, telling us that this pronouncement would have ongoing consequences which would unfold throughout time)) to ( la) the Children ( ben) of Yisra\u2019el ( yisra\u2019el \u2013 those who engage and endure with God), \u201cI Am ( \u2018ehayah \u2013 first person singular of the verb hayah, meaning I exist; written in the qal stem, imperfect conjugation, affirming the reliability and ongoing consequences of His existence on our existence), He has sent me ( salah \u2013 He has reached out and extended Himself to actually dispatch me (in the qal perfect, telling us that this act of God is indivisible, whole and complete, and valid throughout all time, and as a result, should not be compartmentalized into separate chronologies)) to you ( \u2018el) .\u201d\u2019\u201d ( Shemowth / Names / Exodus 3:14)\nThere may be no more profound a statement, no more important a mission, no higher authority. The source of our existence, the one God who actually exists, was going to go from Arabia to the Nile Delta with an eighty-year-old shepherd to rescue His wayward and oppressed children from Egypt\u2014the most oppressive religious, political, and military power man had yet conceived.\nThose who promote the myth that God\u2019s name isn\u2019t known, that it isn\u2019t important, and that it cannot and should not be pronounced, stop reading at this point. But God was not finished speaking \u201cAnd ( wa) God ( \u2018elohym \u2013 Almighty), moreover ( \u2018owd \u2013 besides this and in addition), said ( \u2018amar \u2013 declared) to ( \u2018el) Moseh ( Moseh \u2013 from mashah, the one who would draw us away from human oppression and divine judgment), \u2018This is what ( koh) you should say ( \u2018amar \u2013 promise and declare (also scribed in the qal imperfect)) to ( \u2018el) the Children of Yisra\u2019el ( beny yisra\u2019el \u2013 the children and sons who strive, contend, and struggle with, those who engage, persist, and endure with, those who persevere with, and who are set free and empowered by God), \u201cYahowah ( - - \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u2013 Yahowah), God ( \u2018elohym) of your fathers ( \u2018ab), God ( \u2018elohym) of Abraham ( \u2018Abraham \u2013 Loving, Enriching, and Merciful Father), God ( \u2018elohym) of Yitzchaq ( Yitzchaq \u2013 Laughter), and God ( \u2018elohym) of Ya\u2019aqob ( Ya\u2019aqob \u2013 One who Supplants and Digs in His Heels), He sent me ( salah \u2013 He has reached out and extended Himself to actually dispatch me (in the qal perfect, revealing that this act of God is indivisible, whole and complete, and valid throughout all time)) to you ( \u2018el) .\u201d\nThis is ( zeh) My name ( shem \u2013 My personal and proper designation (scribed in the singular construct form, making Yahowah inseparable from His one and only shem \u2013 name)) forever ( la \u2018olam \u2013 for all time and into eternity). And ( wa) this is ( zeh) My way of being known and remembered ( zeker \u2013 My status and renown, My way of being mentioned and recalled, My commemoration and memorial, My inheritance right, symbol, sign, and signature) for ( la) all places, times, and generations ( dowr dowr) .\u2019\u201d ( Shemowth / Names / Exodus 3:15)\nSo, how does anyone justify calling God \u201cLord\u201d when God said as clearly as words allow: \u201cMy name is Yahowah. That is the way I want to be recalled, the way I want to be known, and the way I want to be remembered. Yahowah is My signature. Tell those who want to live with Me, those who want to be saved by Me, that Yahowah has sent you.\u201d Know it, say it, remember it.\nNow that we have allowed God to resolve the myth that He has many names, some of which are too sacred to be spoken, what about the myth that no one knows how to pronounce the \u201cTetragrammaton,\u201d or \u201cfour consonants\u201d which comprise His signature.\nTo begin, Yahowah\u2019s name is comprised of vowels, not consonants. Flavius Josephus, the most famous of all Jewish historians, wrote in the first-century CE, in his The War of the Jews, Book 5.5.7: \u201cthe set-apart name, it consists of four vowels.\u201d Weingreen, a noted scholar in Hebrew grammar, subsequently stated in 1959 for Oxford University Press: \u201cLong before the introduction of vowels signs, it was felt that the main vowel sounds should be indicated in writing, and so the three letters, Wah (\u05d5), Hey (\u05d4), and Yowd (\u05d9) were used to represent long vowels.\u201d\nIn actuality, the easiest way to dispense with the \u201cconsonant\u201d myth with regard to the Ancient, Paleo, and Babylonian Hebrew scripts found in Scripture is to examine the many thousands of words which contain the letters Wah (\u05d5), Hey (\u05d4), and Yowd (\u05d9), and consider how they are pronounced. Almost invariably, the Waw, or Wah ( - - \u05d5), conveys the vowel sounds \u201co,\u201d \u201coo,\u201d or \u201cu.\u201d In this regard, it is similar to the vowel form of the English W, which is pronounced \u201cdouble u.\u201d The Hey ( - - \u05d4) is pronounced \u201cah\u201d and, to a significantly lesser degree, \u201ceh.\u201d The Yowd ( - - \u05d9) communicates an \u201ci\u201d sound, and is otherwise similar to the vocalization of the vowel form of the English Y.\nIn reality, these three vowels, in conjunction with the Hebrew Aleph ( - - \u05d0) and Ayin ( - - \u05e2), made it possible to pronounce every Hebrew word several millennia before the Sheva System was developed, or vowel points were introduced, by the Masoretes.\nWith this in mind, let\u2019s consider the three vowels which comprise Yahowah\u2019s name. Perhaps the most familiar Hebrew word known to us today beginning with the letter Yowd (\u05d9) is \u201c yada\u2019 ( \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 ),\u201d meaning \u201cto know.\u201d You often hear it repeated: \u201c yada, yada, yada .\u201d Indirectly, we know the Yowd sound from Israel, which is a transliteration of Yisra\u2019el. It is also the source of the vowel I/i in: Isaiah (Yasha\u2019yah), Messiah (Ma\u2019aseyah), Zechariah (Zakaryahuw), Hezekiah (Chazayah), Nehemiah (Nachemyah), and Moriah (Mowryah).\nThose who have sung \u201ckumbaya ( quwmbayah (stand with Yah))\u201d or \u201challelujah ( halaluyah (radiate Yah\u2019s light))\u201d know this Yowd (\u05d9) sound all too well. The \u05d9 provides the vowel sound for the common Hebrew words yad \u2013 hand, yadah \u2013 to acknowledge, yatab \u2013 good, and yahad \u2013 united.\nThere are literally thousands of Hebrew words where the Yowd (\u05d9) is pronounced just like the Y/y is in the English words: \u201cyes, yet, yield, yarn, yaw, yawn, yawl, yea, yippee, year, yearn, yeast, yell, yellow, yelp, yeoman, yesterday, you, young, yolk, yonder, and yummy. And just like Hebrew, in English, the letter Y is often a vowel. Consider: \u201cmyth, hymn, my, fly, and cry.\u201d In fact, according to the Oxford Dictionary, \u201cthe letter Y is more often used as a vowel. And in this role it is often interchangeable with the letter I.\u201d This similarity to Hebrew is not a coincidence, because Hebrew served as the world\u2019s first actual alphabet\u2014a word derived from a transliteration of the first two letters of the Hebrew alphabet: Aleph and Beyt.\nThe second and fourth letter in Yahowah\u2019s name is the Hebrew Hey (\u05d4). Curious as to how Yahowah\u2019s name could be based upon hayah (\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4), which begins and ends with \u05d4, and yet most often be transliterated \u201cYahweh,\u201d where the first Hey is pronounced \u201cah,\u201d and the second is pronounced \u201ceh,\u201d I examined every Hebrew word inclusive of the letter \u05d4 \u2013 especially those words concluding with Hey. What I discovered is that just like hayah and \u2018elowah (the basis of \u2018elohym ), the Hebrew \u05d4 is almost invariably pronounced \u201cah.\u201d In fact the ratio of \u201cah\u201d to \u201ceh\u201d in Hebrew words is nearly one hundred to one. So in hayah, Yahowah told us how to pronounce all but one letter of His name.\nAnd yet, in the definitive statement \u201c \u2019elowah hayah \u2013 God exists,\u201d all of our questions are answered. We can simply look to the title Yahowah selected for Himself in this revealing discussion, \u201c \u2018elohym ( \u05d0\u05dc\u05d4\u05d9\u05dd) \u2013 God,\u201d to ascertain how to properly pronounce the Hebrew vowel Wah (\u05d5). You see, \u2018elohym is the contracted, and thus less formal, plural, and thus more inclusive, form of \u2018elowah ( \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4 ), meaning \u201cGod Almighty.\u201d And it is in \u2018elowah ( \u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d4) that we find definitive proof of how to properly communicate the Hebrew \u05d5.\nIronically, even the title Rabbis ultimately pointed to add the first common singular suffix, \u201cmy\u201d to \u201clord,\u201d \u2018adoni, or more correctly, \u2018adonay, to replace Yahowah\u2019s name, was derived from \u2018adown ( \u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05d5\u05b9\u05df ), which actually helps us pronounce His name.\nBut there is another, perhaps even better known, Hebrew word which can assist us in our quest. Scripture\u2019s most often transliterated title, \u201c towrah \u2013 Torah,\u201d meaning \u201cinstructions,\u201d provides all the direction we require to properly pronounce the Hebrew Wah (\u05d5) specifically, and YHWH generally. In the Divine Writ, this title for \u201cinstruction, teaching, direction, and guidance\u201d is written TWRH (right to left as: \u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 ), where the \u201co\u201d sound is derived from the Wah \u05d5.\nIn addition, the most oft\u2019 repeated Hebrew word over the last one hundred generations has been \u201c shalowm ( \u05e9\u05c1\u05b8\u05dc\u05b9\u05d5\u05dd) \u2013 peace,\u201d where once again, we are greeted with the means to properly annunciate the Hebrew Wah \u05d5. And I suppose Zion and Zionist, would be almost as well known. Its basis is spelled tsyown in Hebrew, once again telling us how to pronounce the Wah.\nOther familiar Hebrew words which are pronounced similarly include: gowym \u2013 people (specifically Gentiles), yowm \u2013 meaning day, \u2018adown \u2013 master, \u2018owy \u2013 alas, \u2018owr \u2013 light, \u2018owth \u2013 sign, qowl \u2013 voice, towb \u2013 good, \u2018acharown \u2013 last, and of course \u2018elowah \u2013 God, in addition to the names: Aaron, Jonah, Job, Judah, Moriah, Zion, and Jerusalem from \u2018Aharown, Yownah, Yowb, Yahuwdah, Mowryah, Tsyown, and Yaruwshalaym.\nTherefore, the obvious pronunciation of YHWH (or - - \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 written left to right using Hebrew characters) is Y\u00b7aH\u00b7oW\u00b7aH. Mystery solved.\nSince Yahowah invented the language of revelation, we are wise to observe its lessons. In Ancient Hebrew, the first letter of Yahowah\u2019s name was a Yad, which today is called a Yowd. It was conveyed using a pictographic depiction of an open hand reaching down and out to us. This hand symbolized the power and authority to do whatever work was required. Even today, yad means \u201chand\u201d in Hebrew, and metaphorically, it still represents the ideas of \u201cengaging and doing,\u201d and thus of \u201cauthority and power.\u201d With Yah, the reveals His willingness to reach down to lift us up, to extend Himself and reach out to us with an open hand, hoping that we will grasp hold of Him.\nThe second and fourth letter in Yahowah\u2019s name is a Hey. It was drawn as a person standing and reaching up while pointing to the heavens . In Ancient Hebrew it conveyed the importance of observing what God has revealed, of becoming aware of Him, and of reaching up to Him for help. Affirming this, the Hebrew word hey still means \u201cbehold\u201d in addition to \u201cpay attention.\u201d The key aspect of this character, which is repeated twice in Yahowah\u2019s name, is that the individuals depicted are standing upright, so as to walk to and with God. They are not shown bowing down in worship. Further, both hands are raised as if to grasp hold of Yahowah\u2019s hand, trusting Him to lead us home.\nIn this regard it is interesting to note that there are five hands depicted in Yahowah\u2019s name \u2013 \u2013 just as there are five terms and conditions associated with His Covenant which we must accept if we want to engage in a relationship with God. And like our hand which is comprised of a thumb and four fingers, there is one prerequisite associated with our participation in the Covenant and then four subsequent requirements. Therefore, Yahowah is telling us that while He is offering to do the work, we control our destiny by our response to Him.\nThe third letter in - - \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 - YHWH is the Wah, which was called Waw in Ancient Hebrew. Its pictographic representation was drawn in the form of a tent peg or stake . These were used to secure a shelter and to enlarge it. And as such, the preposition wa communicates the ideas of adding to and of increasing something.\nBringing this all together, we discover that Yahowah\u2019s name is about our response to His offer. says that God has the power, the authority, and the will to do whatever work needs to be accomplished to assist those who look to Him, who observe His revelation, and who reach up to Him for help. Those who do these things will be added to His family. They will be sheltered and become secure.\nNow that we understand the most important name in the universe, let\u2019s turn our attention to the second: Yahowsha\u2019 \u2013 or sometimes transliterated Yahuwshuwa\u2019, or simply Yahushua, even Yahshua. The alternative ending ( shuwa\u2019 versus sha\u2019) is derived from Dabarym / Words / Deuteronomy 3:21 and Judges 2:7, where we find \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7, as opposed to \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05bb\u05e2\u05b7. Each of the other 216 times His name is scribed we find the preferred \u201cYahowsha\u2019.\u201d\nThis name \u2013 or \u2013 is equal parts an identity designation and a mission statement. As a compound of Yahowah\u2019s name and yasha\u2019, the Hebrew word for \u201csalvation and deliverance,\u201d Yahowsha\u2019 tells us that Yahowah, Himself, is engaged in the process of saving us.\nAs for the name \u201cJesus,\u201d which is more familiar, it is important to note that it cannot be found anywhere in God\u2019s Word. As a matter of fact, there was and is no J in the Hebrew alphabet\u2014nor one in Greek or Latin. The letter was not invented until the mid 16 th -century, precluding anyone named \u201cJesus\u201d existing prior to that time.\nThe first English book to make a clear distinction between the \u201cI\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d was published in 1634, where the new letter d\u00e9buted on loan words from other languages, specifically Hallelujah rather than Halaluyah (meaning: radiate Yahowah\u2019s brilliant light). For those who relish dates, you may have noticed that 1634 is twenty-three years after the first edition of what was then called \u201c The King Iames Bible \u201d was printed in 1611. In it, Yahowsha\u2019 was called \u201cIesous.\u201d\nTherefore, we can say with absolute certainty that no one named \u201cJesus\u201d lived in the 1 st -century CE. \u201cJesus\u201d is a 17 th -century forgery. More troubling still, \u201cJesus\u201d is most closely allied linguistically with \u201cGesus\u201d (pronounced \u201cJesus,\u201d), the savior of the Druid religion (still practiced throughout England), wherein the \u201cHorned One\u201d was considered god.\nThere are a plethora of Christian (a title we will refute momentarily) apologists who errantly claim that \u201cJesus\u201d was a transliteration of the Greek Iesou, Iesous, and Iesoun. The problem with that theory is four fold. Yahowsha\u2019 wasn\u2019t Greek; He was Hebrew from the tribe of Yahuwdah. The Greek Iota is pronounced like the English I, rather than the come-lately J. The \u201cu,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cun\u201d endings were derivatives of Greek grammar and gender rules without a counterpart in Hebrew or English. And most importantly, you won\u2019t find Iesou, Iesous, or Iesoun written on any page of any first-, second-, third-, or even early fourth-century Greek manuscript of the so-called \u201cChristian New Testament.\u201d Divine Placeholders were universally deployed (without exception) by the Disciples to convey Yahowah\u2019s and Yahowsha\u2019s name. Simply stated: it is impossible to justify the use of \u201cJesus.\u201d And it is wrong.\nYahowsha\u2019, as a compound of \u201cYahowah\u201d and \u201c yasha\u2019 \u2013 salvation,\u201d means \u201cYah Saves.\u201d Yahowsha\u2019 tells us that Yahowah manifest Himself in the form of a man, and that as a man, He, Himself, delivered us. Yahowsha\u2019 explains who He is and it defines His purpose.\nSo that there be no dispute: in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, you will find Yahowsha\u2019 \u2013 - - \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05bb\u05e2\u05b7 \u2013 written 216 times\u2014first in Shemowth / Names / Exodus 17:9. The Savior\u2019s name was written Yahowshuwa\u2019 ( \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7) twice (in Dabarym / Words / Deuteronomy 3:21 and then in Shaphatym / Judges 2:7). In addition, Yashuwa\u2019 was scribed in the revealed text on 30 occasions. And Yashuw\u2019ah appears another 78 times. Collectively, these 326 Scriptural witnesses to the descriptive name and title of God\u2019s implement and mission tell us that Yahowah is the source of our Salvation.\nThere are many Messianic Jews, countless rabbis, and otherwise misinformed pseudo-intellectuals who choose to ignore the Scriptural pronunciation of Yahowsha\u2019 (even though it is written 216 times in this form) in favor of Yeshu (which was never written in the Torah, Prophets, or Psalms). The earliest undisputed extant occurrence of Yeshu is found in five brief anecdotes in the Babylonian Talmud (a collection of rabbinical discussions constituting Jewish Oral Law circa 500 CE). Yeshu is cited as the teacher of a heretic (in Chullin 2:22-24, Avodah Zarah 16-17), as a sorcerer scheduled to be stoned on the eve of Passover (in Sanhedrin 43a), as a son who burns his food in public (in Sanhedrin 103a), as an idolatrous former rabbinical student (in Sanhedrin 107b), and as the spirit of a foreigner who is an enemy of Israel (in Gittin 56b and 57a). Yeshu is also used in the Rabbinical Tannaim and Amoraim as a replacement for Manasseh\u2019s name (he was Hezekiah\u2019s only son, and at twelve upon assuming the throne, he instituted pagan worship in direct opposition to his father) (Sanhedrin 103s and Berakhot 17b). The earliest explicit explanation of the Rabbinical term \u201cYeshu\u201d is found in the mediaeval Toldoth Yeshu narratives which reveal: \u201cYeshu was an acronym for the curse \u2018 yimmach shemo wezikhro, \u2019 which means: \u201cmay his name and memory be obliterated.\u201d\nIf that isn\u2019t sufficiently sobering, if that isn\u2019t enough to make you scream every time you read or hear \u201cYeshu\u201d or its clone, \u201cYehshu,\u201d then you don\u2019t know Him very well.\nThese things known, the second most misleading myth has been lampooned. The human manifestation of Yahowah, the corporeal implement God would use to do the work required to save us, is Yahowsha\u2019. This name, as a synthesis of Yahowah and yasha\u2019, the Hebrew word for \u201csalvation,\u201d affirms that: \u201cYahowah is our Savior.\u201d\nIn Hebrew, the first three letters of Yahowsha\u2019s name mirror those found in Yahowah: . So by way of review, the Yowd represented an open hand at the end of an arm reaching down and out to us: . It symbolized the power and authority to do whatever work was required.\nThe second letter in Yahowsha\u2019, like Yahowah, is Hey, which was drawn in the form of a person standing, reaching up and pointing to the heavens . It conveyed the importance of observing what God has revealed, and of reaching up to Him for assistance. It show us engaged, standing and walking with Yahowah, while holding His hand.\nThe third letter, a Wah, was pictographic depicted via a tent peg . They were used to secure a shelter and to enlarge it so that more people could come inside, be accommodated and protected therein. It spoke of adding to and of increasing something, of being associated with and being connected to someone.\nIn Ancient and Paleo Hebrew, the fourth character, a Shin, was drawn to represent teeth, or , making it symbolic of language and nourishment, even the word. As such, we should see Yahowsha\u2019 as \u201c \u2013 the Word\u201d \u201c \u2013 associated with and connected to\u201d \u201c \u2013 Yah.\nAyin is the final letter in the designation Yahowsha\u2019. Scribed in the form of an eye, it was used to convey the ideas of sight, observation, and knowledge . Even today, ayn is the Hebrew word for \u201ceye, sight, and perspective, leading to discernment and understanding.\u201d\nBringing these images together from Hebrew\u2019s past, we discover that Yahowsha\u2019s name, \u2013 reveals that He represents the word of Yah. He has the power and the authority of Yah to do whatever work is required to assist those who look to Him, who observe His words, and who reach up to Him for help. Those who accept and understand this perspective will be added to His family. They will be sheltered and become secure.\nMoving on to the next religious deception, if \u201cChrist\u201d was Yahowsha\u2019s title, and it\u2019s not, there would still be no justification for writing or saying \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d as if \u201cChrist\u201d was His last name. Moreover, without the definite article, \u201cChrist Jesus\u201d is also wrong. Should \u201cChrist\u201d be valid, and again it is not, the only appropriate use of the title would be as \u201cthe Christ.\u201d\nAs we dig deeper, what we discover is that Classical Greek authors used chrio, the basis of \u201c Christos \u2013 Christ\u201d to describe the \u201capplication of drugs.\u201d A legacy of this reality is the international symbol for medicines and the stores in which they are sold\u2014Rx\u2014from the Greek Rho Chi, the first two letters in chrio. So those who advocate \u201cChrist,\u201d and its derivative, \u201cChristian,\u201d are unwittingly suggesting that Yahowsha\u2019, and those who follow Him, are \u201cdrugged.\u201d\nChristians who protest that \u201cChrist\u201d is simply a transliteration of Christos, Christou, Christo, or Christon, either are not aware, or don\u2019t want you to know, that you will find only one place in the whole of the Greek text prior to the mid 4 th -century where any variation of chrio was actually written\u2014and it does not apply to Yahowsha\u2019. All references to the Ma\u2019aseyah\u2019s title were presented using the Divine Placeholders \u03a7 \u03a3, \u03a7\u03a5, \u03a7\u03a9, and \u03a7\u039d.\nThe only time we find a derivative of chrio in God\u2019s voice is when the Ma\u2019aseyah Yahowsha\u2019 toys with the Laodicean Assembly (representing Protestant Christians living in today\u2019s Western Democracies) in His seventh prophetic letter. To appreciate His sense of humor, and to fully understand the point He was making, realize that the Laodiceans were wealthy and self-reliant. They made a fortune promoting their own brand of ointment for the ears and eyes known as \u201cPhrygian powder\u201d under the symbol \u201cRx.\u201d So referencing their healthcare system, Yahowsha\u2019 admonished: \u201cI advise that you rub ( egchrio \u2013 smear) your eyes with medicinal cake ( kollourion \u2013 a drug preparation for ailing eyes) in order that you might see.\u201d (Revelation 3:18) Therefore, in the singular reference to chrio, the root of christo, in the totality of the pre-Constantine Greek manuscripts of the so-called \u201cChristian New Testament,\u201d Yahowsha\u2019 used it to describe the application of drugs.\nTo further indict \u201cChrist\u201d and \u201cChristian,\u201d even if the tertiary definition of chriso, \u201canointed,\u201d were intended, that connotation still depicts the \u201capplication of a medicinal ointment or drug.\u201d And should we ignorantly and inadvisably jettison this pharmaceutical baggage, we\u2019d still be left with other insurmountable problems associated with \u201cChrist.\u201d\nFirst, the Scriptural evidence from the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms strongly suggests that Yahowsha\u2019s title was not \u201c ha Mashiach, \u201d which means \u201cthe Anointed,\u201d but instead \u201c ha Ma\u2019aseyah, \u201d which translates to \u201cthe Implement Doing the Work of Yahowah.\u201d (More on this in a moment.)\nSecond, \u201c ha Ma\u2019aseyah, \u201d as a Hebrew title, like the name Yahowsha\u2019, should have been transliterated (presented phonetically) in Greek and also English, not translated. For example, the titles Rabbi, Imam, Pharaoh, Czar, Sheik, and Pope were all transliterated, not translated.\nYahowsha\u2019 was not Greek, did not speak Greek, and did not have a Greek name or a Greek title, so to infer that He did by crudely transliterating Ieosus Christos \u201cJesus Christ\u201d is grossly misleading and deceptive.\nThird, there is no justification for using Hellenized nomenclature when addressing a Hebrew concept. And since Yahowsha\u2019 did not communicate in Greek, that language is nothing more than a translation of what He actually conveyed in Hebrew and Aramaic \u2013 a language closely allied with Hebrew. This would be like transliterating Genghis\u2019 \u201cKhan\u201d title, which means \u201cruler\u201d in Mongolian, \u201cSheik Jinjeus,\u201d because we like the letter J, the \u201ceus\u201d ending derived from Greek grammar, and sheik has the same meaning in Arabic. Worse, how about rendering Caesar Augustus, \u201cHairy August,\u201d as that is what caesar means in English. It\u2019s idiotic.\nFourth, the textual evidence suggests that the Divine Placeholders \u03a7 \u03a3, \u03a7\u03a5, \u03a7\u03a9, and \u03a7\u039d were not based upon Christos, Christou, Christo, or Christon, as those who have an aversion to all things Hebrew would have you believe. Consider this: writing about the great fire which swept through Rome in 64 CE, the Roman historian Tacitus (the classical world\u2019s most authoritative voice) in Annals XV.44.2-8, revealed: \u201cAll human efforts and propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the fire was the result of an order [from Nero]. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Chrestucians ( Chrestuaneos) by the populous. Chrestus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate. And a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Iudaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination when daylight had expired.\u201d Chrestus and christos are different words in Greek with very different meanings.\nBut there is more, the Nestle-Aland 27th Edition Greek New Testament reveals that Chrestus (\u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2) was scribed in 1 Shim\u2019own / He Listens / Peter 2:3, not Christos. Their references for this include Papyrus 72 and the Codex Sinaiticus, the oldest extant witnesses of Peter\u2019s (actually of Shim\u2019own Kephas\u2019) letter.\nIn Shim\u2019own\u2019s epistle, one attested by both ancient manuscripts, the Disciple and Apostle tells us: \u201cAs a newborn child, true to our real nature ( logikos \u2013 in a genuine, reasonable, rational, and sensible manner), earnestly desire and lovingly pursue ( epipotheo \u2013 long for, showing great affection while yearning for) the pure and unadulterated ( adolos \u2013 that which is completely devoid of dishonest intent or deceit, and thus is perfect) milk in order to grow in respect to salvation, since we have experienced ( geuomai \u2013 partaken and tasted, have been nourished by) Yahowah ( \u039a\u03a3 \u2013 from a Divine Placeholder) as the Useful Implement and Upright Servant ( Chrestus \u2013 the Upright One who is a superior, merciful, kind, and good tool) .\u201d (1 Shim\u2019own / Peter 2:2-3) The fact that we find Chrestus written in the Codex Sinaiticus, and the placeholder \u03a7\u03a1 \u03a3 written in P72 in the same place in this passage, we have an early affirmation that the Divine Placeholder representing the title \u201cMa\u2019aseyah\u201d was based upon the Greek Chrestus, not Christos.\nAnd while Chrestus isn\u2019t Yahowsha\u2019s title, it is at least an apt translation of it. Chrestus means \u201cuseful implement,\u201d and \u201cupright servant,\u201d as well as \u201cmerciful one.\u201d It was used to \u201cdepict the good and beneficial work of a moral person.\u201d So rather than being \u201cdrugged,\u201d a Chrestucian is a \u201cuseful implement, an upright servant, and a moral person working beneficially\u201d with Yah. Therefore, while using Chrestus would have been an honest mistake, at least, unlike Christos, it would not have been a deliberate deception.\nWith a second and third myth resolved, let\u2019s turn our attention to Yahowsha\u2019s actual title. To begin, let\u2019s consider the issues of consistency and relevance. Most every important name, title, and word associated with Yahowah and our yashuw\u2019ah / salvation bears God\u2019s signature: \u201cYah.\u201d As I have mentioned previously (and actually reveal in the Dabar \u2013 Word chapter of this Volume of Yada Yah ), there are 260 names appearing over 10,000 times in Scripture which incorporate \u201cYah\u201d within them. So please consider the likelihood that Yahowah\u2019s most important title would not be included in that list.\nThe second insight I\u2019d like you to consider relative to the validity of Ma\u2019aseyah versus Mashiach and Messiah is the number of times one versus the other appears in God\u2019s Word. You may be surprised to learn that we know for certain that Ma\u2019aseyah and Ma\u2019seyahuw were written twenty-three times throughout the Prophets and Writings (in Yirmayahuw / Jeremiah, in 1&2 Chronicles, in Ezra / Ezrah, and in Nachemyah / Nehemiah). Mashiach, on the other hand, may have been scribed twice, both times in Dan\u2019el / Daniel. (The reason I wrote \u201cmay\u201d will become evident in a moment.)\nThird, the textual spelling from which Ma\u2019aseyah and Mashiach are vocalized is identical save the concluding letter. Throughout Yah\u2019s Word in Ancient and Paleo Hebrew (twenty-three times in five different books), we discover that the final letter in Ma\u2019aseyah is Hey (\u05d4), providing the same \u201cah\u201d sound as we find at the end of Yahowah\u2019s name. But in the book of Daniel, the only one originally scribed in both Aramaic and Babylonian Hebrew, we find a Chet ( \u05d7) conveying the hard \u201cch\u201d sound. And while these letters would never have been confused in paleo-Hebrew, they are very similar in Babylonian Hebrew (\u05d4 vs. \u05d7). Once a scroll has been unfurled and handled a number of times this minor distinction (the length of the left leg) is often lost.\nSince the evidence is our guide to the truth, be aware that there are eight partial manuscripts of Dany\u2019el / Daniel in the Dead Sea Scroll collection. These were copied between 125 BCE and 50 CE. It should be noted that all four scrolls containing material from the first eight chapters of the book are initially scribed in Babylonian Hebrew, but they switch to Aramaic in the midst of chapter 2, verse 4, and then revert back to Hebrew at the beginning of the eighth chapter. (Along these lines, it is also interesting to be aware that the longer Roman Catholic version of Dany\u2019el, with the Prayer of Azariah, the Song of Three Men, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon, isn\u2019t supported by any Qumran manuscript.)\nNone of the eight scrolls found in the Dead Sea caves provide any witness to the text between Dany\u2019el / Daniel 7:18 and 10:4. And unfortunately, the two passages with references to the Ma\u2019aseyah or ha Mashiach, Dany\u2019el 9:25 and 9:26, are right in the midst of this void. That means the oldest manuscript attesting to this minor difference (the length of the left leg on the concluding letter) with major implications (Ma\u2019aseyah or Mashiach) was written by rabbinical Masoretes in the 11 th -century CE. In this manuscript, known as the Codex Leningradensis (dated to 1008 CE and published in 1937), it is clear to me that the rabbinical agenda affirmed in the 3 rd of Maimonides\u2019 13 Principles of Judaism, which states that God is incorporeal, is on display to distance the Rabbinical Mashiach from Yahowah\u2014a G-d whose name rabbis will neither write nor speak. As such, the evidence on behalf of Ma\u2019aseyah is strong and on behalf of Mashiach is weak.\nFourth, every Scriptural name and title, from Isaiah to Zachariah, from Mount Moriah to the Messiah, which is transliterated \u201ciah\u201d today, is actually \u201cyah\u201d in the revealed text. Just as Qumbayah and Halaluyah speak volumes to those with an ear for Yah\u2019s Word today, so does the legacy of \u201ciah\u201d at the end of \u201cMessiah.\u201d\nFifth, Ma\u2019aseyah provides a perfect depiction of how Yahowah used Yahowsha\u2019. As Ma\u2019aseyah, He was \u201cYah\u2019s Implement, Doing the Work of Yahowah.\u201d Ma\u2019aseyah even serves as the perfect complement to Yahowsha\u2019, whereby we are told: \u201cSalvation is from Yah.\u201d\nSixth, now that we know that the Divine Placeholders used in the Greek text to represent the Ma\u2019aseyah were based upon Chrestus, not Christos, we find a perfect match. Both words convey the same message: Yahowsha\u2019 is Yah\u2019s \u201cUseful Implement,\u201d His \u201cUpright Servant,\u201d who does \u201cGood, Moral, and Beneficial Work.\u201d And that is better than being \u201cChrist/Drugged.\u201d\nIt is therefore reasonable for us to conclude that Yahowah assigned the title Ma\u2019aseyah to Yahowsha\u2019.\nAs has been our custom, let\u2019s examine Ma\u2019aseyah through the lens of Ancient Hebrew\u2014the language of revelation. The first letter, Mah, which is now called Mem, was conveyed by way of waves on water. It symbolized the origin of life and cleansing. And even today, mah in Hebrew means \u201cwater.\u201d\nThe second letter is Ayin. This character, which is also found in Yahowsha\u2019s name, was drawn to depict an eye. It was used to convey the ideas of sight, observation, knowledge, perspective, and understanding.\nThe third letter in Ma\u2019aseyah is Sin, which is called a Samech today. Its graphic symbol was akin to a thorn, a hard sharp object which was known to pierce. It came from a bush which served as a protective barrier from carnivores and ill-tempered men. It conveyed the ideas of cutting, piercing, separating, and dividing, in addition to shielding and protecting.\nThe last two letters in Ma\u2019aseyah are mirrored in the beginnings of Yahowah\u2019s and Yahowsha\u2019s names: . As we now know, the Yowd was drawn to represent the outstretched arm and open hand of God, and it symbolized His power and authority to do whatever work was necessary.\nThe final letter in Ma\u2019aseyah is Hey, whose pictographic form revealed a person reaching up and pointing to the heavens. It conveyed the importance of observing God, and of reaching up to Him for assistance. No one was better at this than Yahowsha\u2019 ha Ma\u2019aseyah.\nThe picture painted by these historical characters \u2013 \u2013 collectively reveals that the Ma\u2019aseyah is the source of life and of spiritual cleansing for those who know and understand Him, who observe His words and deeds from the proper perspective. While He was pierced for our sins, and while He came to bring division, He has the power to protect and shield. As Yahowah\u2019s representative, the Ma\u2019aseyah comes with the power and authority of God. He is literally the hand of God doing the work of God. Those who recognize these things, and who reach up and rely upon Him, will find Him ready and willing to assist.\nWhen it comes to the next corrupt term, a modicum of investigation leads to the inescapable conclusion that the title \u201cBible\u201d was derived from the name of an Egyptian goddess. Especially incriminating in this regard, biblos was not used to describe \u201cScripture\u201d until the fourth century CE, coterminous with the formation of Constantine\u2019s Roman Catholic Church. Prior to that time, biblion, or in the plural biblia, simply described the material upon which the words had been written. This is not unlike calling the Torah \u201cparchment.\u201d\nThe papyrus reeds which grew along the Nile in Egypt were imported into Asia by way of the Phoenician port known as Byblos by the Greeks. Priests taught that the city had been founded by the Phoenician sun deity, Ba\u2019al Chronos, \u201cthe Lord of Time\u201d (a blending of the Hebrew word for Lord, ba\u2019al, and the Greek word for time, chronos ), according to the scholarly tome Mythology of All Races. As such, it was the seat of Adonis (also meaning \u201cthe Lord,\u201d albeit this time from the Hebrew \u2018adonay ).\nMore incriminating still, according to Ausfuhrliches Lexicon of Grecian and Roman Mythology, \u201cthe ancient city of Byblos in Phoenicia was named after Byblis in Egypt.\u201d This town \u201cwas named after the sun goddess Byblis, also known as Byble.\u201d Byblis was the granddaughter of Ra, and was eventually inducted into Roman mythology as a descendant of Apollo. According to Bell\u2019s New Pantheon, \u201cByblia was also the name of Venus,\u201d and thus \u201cshe must be equated with Ishtar,\u201d the Babylonian Queen of Heaven and Mother of God for whom \u201cEaster\u201d was named. This connection was affirmed in An Illustrated Dictionary of Classical Mythology and also in Crowell\u2019s Handbook of Classical Mythology. Therefore, considering the title\u2019s heritage, \u201cBible\u201d is a horrible designation for God\u2019s Word.\nCompounding this mistake, God did not reveal anything even remotely akin to an \u201cOld Testament\u201d or \u201cNew Testament.\u201d The perpetrator of this fraud was Marcion, a raging anti-Semite, who rejected Yahowah and the entirety of His Torah testimony. In the early 2 nd -century CE, Marcion became the first to refer to the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms as the \u201cOld Testament.\u201d The reference was intended to demean it as a document which contained the will of a now deceased deity. In its place, Marcion promoted his \u201cNew Testament,\u201d a canon comprised of Paul\u2019s epistles and of his heavily edited versions of Luke and Acts (written by Paul\u2019s assistant)\u2014in which most everything prescribed in the Torah was removed or demeaned. In the process, Marcion established a division which had not previously existed, and he created the notion that the Torah was now obsolete, having been replaced by the Pauline concept of the \u201cGospel of Grace.\u201d Anything which didn\u2019t support this view was either erased or ignored. It was a transition in perspective from which Christianity would never recover.\nAnd while Marcion was ultimately labeled a heretic by the Roman Catholic Church for his Gnosticism, most everything Marcion promoted remains indelibly woven into the fabric of the Christian religion\u2014especially his influence on the text of the now \u201cChristian New Testament\u201d along with it allegiance to Pauline Doctrine. Marcion was kicked out of the Church, but all things Marcion have remained in it.\nIn support of this anti-Yahowah perspective, Paul, in his letters to the Galatians and Romans, wrote of \u201ctwo covenants,\u201d and he said that the one formalized in the Torah on Mount Sinai was of the flesh and thus evil, a cruel taskmaster, that had not, could not, and would not save anyone. And while we will contemplate Yahowah\u2019s perspective on this to prove otherwise, what about the notion of a \u201csecond, new and different\u201d Covenant? Didn\u2019t the prophet Yirmayahuw / Jeremiah predict the advent of a \u201cNew Covenant?\u201d\nAt first blush, the answer appears to be yes, at least if you consider errant translations and don\u2019t read the entire discussion. The fact is: Yahowah did speak of eventually \u201crenewing, repairing, and restoring the Covenant,\u201d and of this \u201cRenewed Covenant\u201d \u201cnot being exactly the same as\u201d the existing one. But the stated beneficiaries are Yisra\u2019el and Yahuwdah, not the Gentile \u201cchurch.\u201d And their reconciliation with Yahowah has not yet occurred. Therefore, the Covenant has not yet been renewed.\nFurther, those who actually consider Yahowah\u2019s explanation of how His Renewed and Restored Covenant will differ from the Covenant described in His Towrah, discover that \u201cYahowah will give the Towrah, placing it in their [Yisra\u2019el\u2019s and Yahuwdah\u2019s] midst, writing it upon their hearts\u201d so that \u201cI shall be their God, and they shall be My family.\u201d Therefore, this is not about Gentiles, the Church, or a replacement of the Torah with Grace. Indeed, it is just the opposite.\nAs a result of this announcement from God, it would be wrong to refer to the Greek eyewitness accounts as the \u201cRenewed Covenant,\u201d much less the \u201cNew Testament.\u201d The Covenant has not yet been \u201crenewed.\u201d There will never be a \u201cnew\u201d one. And since it is His Word, I think it\u2019s reasonable to use His terms.\nThe most sinister terms which lie at the heart of the Christian deception are both Pauline: \u201cGospel\u201d and \u201cGrace.\u201d So this would be a good time to expose and condemn them.\nChristian apologists almost universally say that \u201cGospel means \u2018good news\u2019\u201d as if they were translating it from the pages of their \u201cNew Testament.\u201d However, no such word is found there. And even if there were a Greek word, \u201cgospel,\u201d whose meaning was \u201cgood news,\u201d why wasn\u2019t it translated: \u201cgood news?\u201d Or more to the point, since euangelion actually means \u201chealing and beneficial message,\u201d why didn\u2019t Christians translate the Greek term which actually appears in the text accurately?\nChristian dictionaries go so far as to say that \u201cgospel is from go (d) meaning \u2018good,\u2019 and spell meaning \u2018news.\u2019\u201d But \u201cgod\u201d was never an Old English word for \u201cgood,\u201d but instead for \u201cgod,\u201d a transliteration of the Germanic \u201cGott,\u201d an epithet for Odin. The Old English word for \u201cgood\u201d was \u201cgud.\u201d And the Middle English \u201cspell\u201d is from the Old English \u201cspellian,\u201d which means \u201cto foretell, to portend, and to relate.\u2019\u201d As such, \u201cgospel\u201d does not mean \u201cgood news\u201d and is therefore not a translation of euangelion. Other dictionaries, suggest that gospel was \u201cderived from an Anglo-Saxon word which meant \u2018the story concerning God\u2019\u201d even though there is no etymological history of such a term in the annals of the Anglo-Saxons.\nIt is also insightful to know that according to Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, the English word \u201cspell,\u201d came to us \u201cfrom Old English by way of Middle English.\u201d And \u201ccirca 1623 (which would be around the time the KJV was being popularized) a spell 1) was a spoken word or form of words which were held to have magic power, 2) was a state of enchantment, or 3) was used in the context of casting a spell.\u201d\nWebster\u2019s Twentieth-Century Dictionary says: \u201cThe word \u2018god\u2019 is common to the Teutonic tongues. It was applied to heathen deities and later, when the Teutonic peoples were converted to Christianity, the word was elevated to the Christian sense.\u201d Then, further affirming that \u201cGospel\u201d conveyed the idea of being under \u201cGott\u2019s spell,\u201d Merriam Webster explains: \u201cgod is from Old English by way of Middle English and is akin to the Old High German got, which was derived before the 12 th century CE.\u201d And gottin, therefore, was the Old High German word for \u201cgoddess.\u201d\nDigging a little deeper in our quest to understand the religious origins of \u201cgospel\u201d circa 17 th -century Europe when the religious connotation was first conceived, the Encyclopedia Britannica reports: \u201cGod is the common Teutonic word for a personal object of religious worship applied to all superhuman beings of the heathen mythologies. The word god, upon the conversion of the Teutonic races to Christianity, was adopted as the name of the one Supreme Being.\u201d So like every Christian corruption of Yahowah\u2019s Word, man\u2019s religious term is drenched in paganism.\nMoving on to Charis, no credible source disputes the fact that it is a transliteration of the name of the three Greek Graces known as the Charities ( Charites ). The English word \u201ccharity\u201d is a direct transliteration. These pagan goddesses of charm, splendor, and beauty, were often depicted in mythology celebrating nature and rejoicing over fertility. Collectively, they make four appearances in Homer\u2019s Iliad and three in the Odyssey.\nThe Charis were the daughters of Dionysus and Aphrodite. And that is particularly troubling because Paul puts one of Dionysus\u2019 most famous quotes in Yahowsha\u2019s mouth during his conversion experience on the road to Damascus. And as it would transpire, Paul\u2019s faith came to mirror the Dionysus cult (Bacchus in Roman mythology) which is one of the reasons why so many aspects of Pauline Christianity are pagan. (These troubling associations are detailed for your consideration in the \u201c Kataginosko \u2013 Convicted\u201d chapter of The Great Galatians Debate in Questioning Paul .)\nThese \u201cGraces\u201d were associated with the underworld and with the Eleusinian Mysteries. Their naked form stands at the entrance of the Acropolis in Athens. Naked frescoes of the Charites adorn homes throughout Pompeii, Italy which means that they transcended the Greek religion and influenced Rome where they became known as the Gratia. Their appeal, beyond their beauty, gaiety, and sensual form, was that they held mysteries known only to religious initiates. Francis Bacon, as the founder of the Rosicrucians, would have loved them.\nAnd yet, the name of the Greek goddesses, Charis \u2013 Charity, memorialized today under their Roman moniker Gratia \u2013 Grace, is the operative term of Galatians\u2014one which puts Paul in opposition to the very Torah and God which condemns the use of such names. Simply stated: the \u201cGospel of Grace\u201d is pagan. It is literally \u201c Gott \u2019s spell of Gratia .\u201d\nIn Pagan Rome, the three Gratia, or Graces, were goddesses of joy, beauty, charm, happiness, and feasts. As personifications of prosperity and well-being, and as the messengers for Aphrodite and Eros, the Gratia served as clever counterfeits for euangelion \u2014Yahowsha\u2019s healing and beneficial message. Therefore, those who conceived the religion of Christianity simply transliterated Gratia, and then based their faith on a new mantra called \u201cthe Gospel of Grace,\u201d unashamed by the fact that their credo bore the name of pagan deities. This is deeply troubling. It is a scar, indeed a mortal wound to Paul\u2019s epistles, and a deathblow to Christendom.\nTo be fair, in ancient languages it\u2019s often difficult to determine if the name of a god or goddess became a word, or if an existing word later became a name. We know, for example, that Greek goddesses, like those in Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, and Rome, bore names which described their mythological natures and ambitions. Such is the case with the Charites. The Charis came to embody everything that the word charis has come to represent: \u201cjoy, favor, mercy, and acceptance, loving kindness and the gift of goodwill.\u201d So, while we can\u2019t be certain if the name Charis was based on the verb chairo, or whether the verb was based upon the name Charis, once Charis / Gratia became a name, it doesn\u2019t matter, as saying it violates Yahowah\u2019s instructions.\nThere are two Hebrew equivalents to the verb charis which are devoid of pagan baggage. Hen, sometimes vocalized chen, is used in its collective forms 193 times in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms. Chen is derived from the verb chanan. As a noun, it means \u201cto favor and to accept by providing an unearned gift,\u201d which is why it is often translated \u201cgrace\u201d in English bibles. To be chanan is \u201cto be merciful, demonstrating unmerited favor,\u201d and as such chanan is usually rendered \u201cto be gracious\u201d in Christian literature. The author of the eyewitness account of Yahowsha\u2019s life, whom we know as \u201cJohn,\u201d was actually Yahowchanan, meaning \u201cYah is Merciful.\u201d\nRacham, which appears 77 times in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms, means \u201cmerciful, loving, compassionate, and tenderly affectionate.\u201d Its shorter form, raham, meaning \u201cmercy,\u201d makes 44 appearances, and the longer form, rachuwm, which also means \u201cmerciful,\u201d is scribed 13 times.\nThe bottom line is: if we are being asked to take the Greek manuscripts seriously, at the very least, the words contained therein should be rendered accurately. And to the extent that Yahowsha\u2019s words have been translated accurately from Hebrew and Aramaic to Greek, and retained appropriately by scribes over the centuries, we are not at liberty to alter His testimony, at least not without consequence.\nCharis only appears once in Yahowsha\u2019s voice, but even then, it is neither accurate nor credible. Yahowsha\u2019 was speaking to Yahowchanan in Heaven, and based upon the rest of His Revelation, we know that He was speaking in Hebrew. Therefore, He would have said \u201c chesed \u2013 mercy,\u201d not \u201c charis \u2013 charity,\u201d much less \u201c gratia \u2013 grace.\u201d And since we do not have a copy of this portion of Revelation dating prior to the time Constantine legitimized Paul\u2019s faith, there is no credible evidence to suggest that Yahowchanan changed chesed to charis.\nThis then brings us to the only other problematic placement of the pagan name\u2014in the first chapter of Yahowchanan\u2019s eyewitness account. But even here, the oldest extant copy of the Disciple\u2019s introductory narrative dates to the late 2 nd or early 3 rd century. And it was professionally scribed in Alexandria, Egypt, where Pauline influences had long since permeated the profession and place. Therefore, while I\u2019m convinced that Yahowchanan didn\u2019t use the term, I cannot prove it, nor can anyone disprove such a claim. And frankly, charis was not among the best words in the Greek lexicon to describe the Hebrew concept of \u201c chesed \u2013 mercy.\u201d (For more on this, I invite you to read Questioning Paul, where this topic is covered in much greater detail.)\nAt best, charis / gratia / grace is misleading. At worst, it attempts to associate one\u2019s salvation to faith in a very popular pagan goddess. So, while using the term to convey \u201cmercy\u201d is misleading, promoting salvation under the auspices of \u201cyou are saved through faith by Grace\u201d is unquestionably deceitful, deadly, and damning.\nSince Yahowah\u2019s descriptive term for \u201cmercy\u201d is chesed, let\u2019s consider its meaning in Ancient Hebrew. Here, the ch sound is from Chet, which, drawn in the form of a barrier, conveyed the idea of protecting by separating. The Shin was depicted using teeth. It spoke of language and nourishment. And the Dalet was a doorway. Therefore, chesed is the Doorway to protection provided by the Word of God. It is the means Yahowah uses to set us apart from the world and unto Him, the very doorway to life eternal in Heaven.\nNow that we understand who Paul was opposing, let\u2019s see if we can ascertain what he was promoting. And for that, we must come to understand the consequence of replacing euangelion with \u201cgospel\u201d in the King James as well as in most all subsequent translations. The result is that Christians now believe that Paul\u2019s preaching was not only focused upon, but was also limited to, what have become known as the \u201cGospels\u201d of \u201cMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John.\u201d But there are a host of irresolvable problems with this theory.\nFirst, Sha\u2019uwl never quoted a single line from any of them. He didn\u2019t even reference them. Worse, in Galatians we learn that Paul not only despised the three most important Disciples\u2014Shim\u2019own \u2013 Peter, Yahowchanan \u2013 John, and Ya\u2019aqob \u2013 James\u2014he openly condemned their witness. As such, the notion that Paul preached the message contained in their \u201cGospels\u201d is ludicrous.\nSecond, the biographical accounts attributed to \u201cMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John\u201d were not called \u201cGospels.\u201d No such word existed at the time they were written. \u201cGospel\u201d was a product of the 17 th century.\nThird, since Paul wrote Galatians around 50 CE, the evidence suggests that Mattanyah \u2013 Matthew\u2019s eyewitness account was still in its original Hebrew. And while it was cherished in Yaruwshalaym \u2013 Jerusalem, it wasn\u2019t widely distributed at this time, and thus would not have been known to the Galatians, or the Corinthians, Thessalonians, or Romans.\nMoving on to Mark, Eusebius wrote: \u201cMarcus, who had been Petra\u2019s interpreter, wrote down carefully all that he remembered of Iesous\u2019 sayings and doings. For he had not heard Iesous or been one of his followers, but later, he was one of Petra\u2019s followers.\u201d Origen, Tertullian, and Clement concurred, writing at the end of the 2 nd century that \u201cMarcus compiled his account from Petra\u2019s speeches in Roma.\u201d As such, Paul\u2019s letter to the Galatians predates Mark\u2019s presentation of Shim\u2019own / Peter\u2019s testimony by a decade.\nFurther, according to the book of Acts, Luke, its author, hadn\u2019t appeared on the scene by this time. Therefore, his historical portrayal would not be written for at least a decade following the time Galatians was penned. Also, based upon the enormous popularity of Yahowchanan \u2013 John\u2019s eyewitness account (evidenced by the sheer volume of extant pre-Constantine manuscripts), had his portrayal of Yahowsha\u2019s life been circulated by this time, Paul would have been compelled to reference it. And that is especially true in Asia Minor, because Yahowchanan had established himself in Ephesus.\nTherefore, at the time this letter to the Galatians was written, Scripture existed solely of the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms. It still does. And that means that Paul\u2019s \u201cGospel of Grace,\u201d rather than being a summation of \u201cMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John,\u201d was unassociated with them\u2014even hostile to them.\nAs you shall discover if you read Questioning Paul in The Great Galatians Debate, the self-proclaimed apostle\u2019s \u201cGospel of Grace\u201d was overtly opposed to the message Yahowsha\u2019 affirmed and fulfilled. Simply stated, neither \u201cGospel\u201d nor \u201cGrace\u201d are Godly, appropriate, or reliable. The Old English moniker, \u201cGospel,\u201d like the use of the Greek goddess\u2019 name, Charis, known by the Latinized \u201c Gratia \u2013 Grace,\u201d has caused millions to believe that the \u201cGospel of Grace\u201d replaced the Torah, when according to God, the Torah is the source of His \u201cchesed \u2013 gift of favor and mercy.\u201d No Torah, no \u201cMercy.\u201d\nTherefore, you will not find \u201cGospel\u201d or \u201cGrace\u201d in these pages\u2014unless it is to expose and condemn the terms. Yahowah\u2019s actual designation is far superior and it has no demonic overtones.\nThroughout Yada Yah, and thus also in An Introduction to God, the title \u201cChurch\u201d is only used in a derogatory sense. So this is the perfect time to uncover another of Christianity\u2019s most ignoble myths. With \u201cchurch,\u201d we discover that nothing remotely akin to it appears anywhere in Scripture.\nThe notion of a \u201cchurch\u201d began when Catholic clerics chose to replace the Greek word, ekklesia, meaning \u201ccalled-out assembly,\u201d rather than translate it (replicating its meaning (which is required for words)) or transliterate it (replicating its pronunciation (which is permissible with titles)).\nThis counterfeit has served to hide the fact that the source, the meaning, and the purpose of the \u201c ekklesia \u2013 called out\u201d was delineated in the Torah, Prophets, and Psalms by way of the essential Hebrew title, Miqra\u2019, which means \u201cCalled-Out Assembly.\u201d Yahowah used Miqra\u2019 to describe the nature of the seven annual meetings He established with mankind, whereby we were invited to answer His summons to appear before Him, reading and reciting His Torah. Simply stated: Yahowah\u2019s Miqra\u2019ey (Called-Out Assembly Meetings) gave birth to Yahowsha\u2019s Ekklesia (Called-Out Assembly). Observing the Torah\u2019s presentation of \u201c Mow\u2019ed Miqra\u2019ey \u2013 Called-Out Assembly Appointments to Meet\u201d on \u201c Pesach \u2013 Passover,\u201d \u201c Matsah \u2013 Unleavened Bread,\u201d \u201c Bikuwrym \u2013 FirstFruits,\u201d \u201c Shabuwa\u2019 \u2013 Seven Sabbaths,\u201d \u201c Taruw\u2019ah \u2013 Trumpets,\u201d \u201c Kippurym \u2013 Reconciliations,\u201d and \u201c Sukah \u2013 Shelters\u201d represents the Way to enjoy eternal life as a child in our Heavenly Father\u2019s family.\nChristian apologists, however, will protest that their \u201cchurch\u201d was derived from the Greek kuriakon. But that\u2019s absurd in the extreme. Why would someone translate a Greek word by replacing it with a different Greek word, especially one with an entirely divergent meaning? It is as odd as replacing Torah with Tadpole. Worse, even if the Greek text said kuriakon rather than ekklesia, the case cannot be made that kuriakon sounds like church, further incriminating the religious men who justify this exchange. As such, all of the religious arguments that \u201cchurch\u201d is a transliteration of kuriakon, which is somehow a translation of ekklesia, fail the test of reason.\nShould you be curious, kuriakon, or kuriakos as it is sometimes written, is based upon kurios, which means \u201clord and master, the one who rules by usurping freewill.\u201d This of course is wholly unrelated to ekklesia, which literally means \u201cto call out\u201d\u2014and thus serves as an invitation. And yet, since the Catholic Church needed a system whereby they could control and fleece the masses, subjecting them to their control, buildings were built and a religious institution was established under the moniker of: \u201cthe Church.\u201d\nI find it interesting to note that a derivative of the Greek kuriakon was used by the false-prophet Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians (verse 11:20) to obfuscate the celebration of \u201c Pesach \u2013 Passover,\u201d replacing it with the religious notion of \u201cthe Lord\u2019s Supper\u201d\u2014which has subsequently evolved to become the Eucharist and Communion.\nTurning to Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, in the 1909 edition, their explanation begins: \u201cChurch, noun. [of Medieval origin. Chirche from the Anglo-Saxon circe].\u201d They then describe church as \u201c1. a building; 2. a place of worship for any religion.\u201d\nSince there is no connection of any kind between \u201c ekklesia \u2013 called out\u201d and a building or a place of worship, we must conclude that the religious corruption of the Greek word has effectively hidden and then changed its original meaning. And in so doing, the Church severed God\u2019s overt linguistic association between miqra\u2019 and ekklesia, erasing the essential connection between Yahowah\u2019s Called-Out Assembly Meetings and Yahowsha\u2019s Called-Out Assembly, thereby separating billions of souls from their Creator, Father, and Savior.\nWhile \u201cchurch\u201d isn\u2019t a translation of ekklesia, or even a transliteration of kuriakon, there is an unmistakable phonetic link to the Druid, and thus Anglo-Saxon and Germanic words chirche and circe \u2014consistent with what we just discovered in Webster\u2019s Dictionary. The Oldest Druid temples were built as circles, a transliteration of circe, to represent their god, the sun. Worse, most every encyclopedia of mythology reveals that Circe was a sun goddess, the daughter of Helios. And if that were not enough to make you want to scream, the \u201cSavior\u201d of the Druid religion (where the \u201cHorned One\u201d is god) was named \u201cGesus,\u201d which was pronounced: \u201cJesus.\u201d\nThe best that can be said is that \u201cChurch,\u201d unlike the word it replaced, ekklesia, conveys no relevant spiritual message. Whereas Ekklesia is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Miqra\u2019, telling us that Yahowsha\u2019s Called-Out Assembly is based upon the Torah\u2019s Called-Out Assembly Meetings.\nThere is also no Scriptural basis whatsoever for the primary symbol of Christendom. The gruesome crucifixes that ghoulishly adorn Catholic cathedrals and the towering crosses set atop Church steeples and worn around the necks of Protestants are a legacy of Babylon\u2019s sun-god religion. The Ma\u2019aseyah\u2019s body was indeed affixed to an upright pole on Passover, but just like Passover, His blood was smeared on an upright pillar and on a lintel forming the doorway to salvation.\nYada Yah, as you are now discovering, was written to confirm what Yahowah had to say regardless of how many money-making myths and convenient religious rituals it skewers. In that regard, the commentary exists to encourage you to think more deeply about His message. If I feel inspired after examining an amplified passage up close, I\u2019ll share what I have learned. Hopefully, my comments will stimulate your thought processes as we travel together through this remarkable voyage through time, space, and words.\nThis Re\u2019syth \u2013 Beginning Prelude to Yada Yah composed long after I had completed the first twenty-five-hundred pages of this book on Yahowah\u2019s book. Therefore, I already know much of what you are going to discover. And I know that these revelations are going to affect everyone differently.\nIf you are an atheist reading Yada Yah, you will soon come to realize that your faith in science and man is misplaced. Secular Humanism requires an abandonment of reason. To believe that life is the result of random chance requires a much greater leap of faith than does acknowledging the obvious signs of intelligent design. In reality, the primary axiom of Darwinian Evolution, and the very foundation of secular humanism, that random mutations coupled with natural selection led to life as we know it, is irrefutably false. Further, every attempt man has made toward understanding his existence has led to far more questions than answers. And the attempts mankind has made to govern our affairs apart from God have resulted in more deaths and destruction than have come from the hands of all those who have falsely claimed to have ruled in the name of God. While all religions are bad, the religion of man is the most deceitful, destructive, and deadly of all.\nIf you are an agnostic, you are going to be pleasantly surprised. Most all of the rational reasons you have used to see God as unknowable will vanish. You will discover that the lack of reason and silliness which permeate religion, things that may have kept you from forming a relationship with Yahowah, don\u2019t exist in Scripture. The idiocy is clerical, not divinely inspired.\nAccording to Yahowah\u2019s revelation, Buddhists will achieve the state of nothingness they desire. But one doesn\u2019t have to be a Buddhist to find this place. Scripture refers to this result as the dissipation of the soul.\nYah\u2019s Word doesn\u2019t have much to say about Hinduism. It is replete, however, with countless insights into the nature of the spirit who benefits from pagan doctrines which advance the false notion of reincarnation and which obliterate choice. Scripture is not kind to doctrines which oppress through the establishment of restrictive caste systems.\nAs for Muslims, Yahowah has a great deal to say about you, and it is all bad. Everything you have been led to believe is the inverse of the truth. Allah is Satan, not God. Muhammad was a perverted pirate, not a prophet. While I doubt many of you will be capable of abandoning the religion that is so good at being bad, for those of you who can, you will find truth and God in these pages.\nIf you are a religious Christian, especially if you are Orthodox or Catholic, you will be horrified, even angered for having been purposefully deceived\u2014for having been played for a fool. Hopefully, you will be awakened from the demonic trance that has been perpetrated upon you. But your ability to accept Yahowah\u2019s testimony and reject man\u2019s, will depend upon your willingness to abandon those who have abused you. And that\u2019s not easy because it means leaving your comfort zone and confronting established customs, as well as family and friends. Catholicism, and its stepdaughter Protestant Christianity, is a very well woven lie, a superbly crafted counterfeit, one which covers the Light like a dense, dank, and dark blanket.\nMany evangelical Christians have come to know that something is dreadfully wrong with their church. For those who do, you will discover exactly what that is in these pages. Yet for the evangelicals who think their church is divine, you will find Yah\u2019s Words as unfamiliar to you as \u201cLord Jesus Christ,\u201d \u201cSunday Worship,\u201d and \u201cPauline Doctrine,\u201d are to Him. I\u2019m afraid you will have to unlearn what you\u2019ve been taught before you will be able to accept what is actually true.\nIf you are Jewish, you will come to realize that if Yahowsha\u2019 is not the Ma\u2019aseyah, there can be no Ma\u2019aseyah. Most of the prophecies He satisfied can no longer be fulfilled. If He didn\u2019t walk into Yaruwshalaym on Branch Monday, four days before Passover in 33CE in accord with Dany\u2019el 9\u2019s prophetic timeline, if He wasn\u2019t the Suffering Servant and Sacrificial Lamb of Yasha\u2019yahuw 53 and Mizmowr / Song / Psalm 22, the Scriptures which brought us the concept of the Ma\u2019aseyah (the Implement of Yah) aren\u2019t reliable.\nIt\u2019s a catch 22. If the Hebrew Scriptures weren\u2019t inspired and aren\u2019t reliable, then the Babylonian Talmud can\u2019t be reliable either because it is based upon the Tanakh (Torah, Prophets, and Psalms). Further, since Rabbinical Judaism is based upon the Oral Law of the Talmud, it can\u2019t be rational because its teachings routinely contradict the Torah\u2014the very book from which it derives its authority. If the Scriptures are true, then books and doctrines which contradict them cannot be true. If the Scriptures aren\u2019t true, then religions which claim they are, aren\u2019t reliable.\nAs stated earlier, this logical paradox is the bane of religions like Judaism, Catholicism, Protestant Christianity, Mormonism, and Islam, all of which contradict the Scriptures they acknowledge were inspired\u2014the very book from which they all pretend to garner their authority. When clerics replaced God\u2019s teachings with their own, they embarked upon a lose-lose scenario. If Scripture is inspired, and thus right, they must be wrong because each of these religions advocate positions that are the antithesis of Yahowah\u2019s teaching. And should Scripture not be inspired, each of these religions, based upon their own claims, must be errant because they all purport otherwise. Therefore, the only rational conclusion is that Judaism, Catholicism, Protestant Christianity, Mormonism, and Islam are false.\nFrom Yahowah\u2019s perspective, religion is mankind\u2019s greatest foe, and our most unrelenting enemy. And in that light, Yada Yah may be the most unreligious volume of books you will ever read. It will be like having a conversation with God.\nLE: YY 12-03-12\n\n", "docid": "msmarco_doc_11_15742781"}

Like, if I'm overly excited you would never tell. It's only noticable when I'm upset, and I hate when people can see that I'm upset. I certainly don't show that much kindness at all. Same goes with murderous intent. All those thoughts stay in my head or written down on notes that I may potentially slip into their backpack...\nPeople are only a bit scared when I'm mad because of a joke. They just know that I CAN beat the crap outta them. But we usually joke around when I'm mad, and it's only likely I will snap.\nI'm not THAT jealous. At the most, I'll go ahead and warn the person that I'm a bit upset. But I won't murder them unless they seriously make me mad.\nI've been trying to find out my dere type lately and it hasn't been resting with me.

Updated 26 April 2021.\n+Related Content\nKey Facts\nFemale sterilization is a permanent contraceptive.\nIt\u2019s more than 98% effective as a form of birth control.\nIt does not protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nTubal ligation\nFemale sterilization, also called \u201ctubal sterilization\u201d is a huge decision because it\u2019s a permanent type of contraceptive. This means that it protects against pregnancy forever. Individuals who choose this option usually do not want any children, or do not want any more, or cannot carry a pregnancy because of a medical condition. Another option for permanent birth control is male sterilization (vasectomy).\nOut of 100 individuals using female sterilization\nTypical use: 1 or fewer individuals become pregnant\n\nPerfect use: 1 or fewer individuals become pregnant\n\nWhat is tubal ligation?\n\u201cTubal\u201d refers to the fallopian tubes. Ligation means to tie off, cut or close. Tubal ligation involves having minor surgery.\nWhy are the \u201cfallopian tubes\u201d sterilized?\nThe fallopian tubes (see picture above) is where an egg and sperm meet, and where the egg becomes fertilized before it moves to the uterus. By closing off the tubes, sperm can\u2019t get to the egg which means that pregnancy can\u2019t happen.\nHow is female sterilization done?\nFemale sterilization can be done in an operating room or in a medical office depending on the type of procedure. It can be done while you are sleeping or while you are awake. If awake, you will be given numbing medicine so you don\u2019t feel too uncomfortable. Depending on the type of method you choose to have, you could either have a small incision or cut in your abdomen (belly) or the procedure can be done vaginally (without any incisions or cuts).\nLaparoscopic sterilization: This procedure is done in an operating room under general anesthesia (while sleeping). A small cut is made in the abdomen (belly) and then an instrument with a tiny camera (called a laparoscope) is placed inside the belly near the navel (belly button). The fallopian tubes (the tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus) are then closed shut with another instrument. It can be done at any time during a woman\u2019s cycle except immediately after she delivers a baby. It works immediately so using additional kinds of birth control to prevent pregnancy isn\u2019t necessary. However, you should continue to use condoms to prevent STIs.\nThe fallopian tubes are cut and tied, removed, stitched with suture material, or burned. The fallopian tubes can also be entirely removed; this is called salpingectomy (sal\u00b7\u200bpin\u00b7\u200bgec\u00b7\u200bto\u00b7\u200bmy)\nSterilization using electrical current: An electrical current is used to burn and destroy the fallopian tubes after they have been cut. Sterilization done with an electrical current cannot be reversed.\nSilicone band (tubal ring): Through the laparoscope, the surgeon will insert a special tool that stretches a plastic band, picks up a small loop of the fallopian tube, and places the plastic band over the loop. The tube is then clamped shut.\nSpring clips: There are two types of clips that are used to clamp off the tubes. One, shaped like a clothespin, is placed over the fallopian tube and is held closed by its spring clip. The other type is a rounded clamp, which is closed over the fallopian tubes. The clamp\u2019s plastic liner gets bigger to keep the tube closed as the tube flattens.\nMinilaparotomy (mini\u00b7\u200blap\u00b7\u200ba\u00b7\u200brot\u00b7\u200bo\u00b7\u200bmy ): This procedure is also done in an operating room with general or local anesthesia (numbing medicine) usually within 1-2 days after an individual gives birth.\nAre there any risks or complications with female sterilization?\nComplications are rare and are usually from general anesthesia or surgery. Individuals who have other medical conditions that make surgery risky should have a thoughtful discussion with their health care provider about the procedure. There is a low risk of hurting the bowel, bladder or major blood vessel. If an electric current is used to destroy the fallopian tubes, there is a low risk of burning the skin and/or bowel or other internal organs. Other complications include bleeding and infection. The chance of becoming pregnant after being sterilized is rare. However, if pregnancy occurs, an individual is more likely to have a tubal or ectopic pregnancy (this means that the pregnancy is in their fallopian tube instead of in their uterus, which can be dangerous).\nWhat should I expect after the laparoscopic surgery?\nYou may have symptoms after the laparoscopic surgery including:\nDizziness\nShoulder pain\nCramps\nBloated or gassy feeling\nAfter your laparoscopic procedure, you will stay in the recovery room until you are wide awake and able to eat and drink light foods such as crackers and ginger ale. Most individuals go home within 2-4 hours on the same day. You\u2019ll need someone to bring you to the hospital and take you home. Some women may have mild discomfort for a few days. If any of the symptoms below last longer than a couple of days, call your health care provider. Most individuals can go back to school or work within 1 week of having the procedure, but everyone is different so be sure to listen to what your health care provider tells you.\nDoes female sterilization work?\nFemale sterilization is one of the best methods of birth control available. It\u2019s close to 100% effective. This means that out of 100 individuals who have a sterilization procedure, less than 1 would expect to become pregnant each year.\nDoes female sterilization protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?\nFemale sterilization does not protect against sexually transmitted infections. Using condoms every time you have sex is recommended and greatly lowers the risk of getting an STI.\nWill female sterilization affect my sex life?\nNo. Female sterilization will not change anything such as your sexual performance or your ability to have orgasms. In fact, some women feel more relaxed during sex because they\u2019re not worried about becoming pregnant. Neither you nor your partner will be able to feel the clips or rings that may have been used to seal off your tubes.\nWill my periods be the same after female sterilization?\nYour periods will likely be the same. Medical studies have shown that individuals who are sterilized may in fact have fewer days of bleeding with their menstrual cycle, have a lighter flow and less menstrual cramps. A very small number of individuals may complain of irregular periods and menstrual cramping after sterilization.\nIf you have any of the following symptoms, call your health care provider:\nLate or missed menstrual period\nSevere lower abdominal (belly) pain\nNausea \u2013 feeling like you want to throw up\nBreast tenderness\nWhat if I decide I want to get pregnant after I am sterilized?\nTubal ligation should be considered a permanent procedure. The majority of women who choose sterilization are happy with the decision, but some women (14%) will ask about reversing the procedure. Reversal of tubal sterilization is frequently not feasible and can be expensive as it is not routinely covered by insurance.\nFemale sterilization is safe and a good option for some individuals such as young adults who have a very serious medical condition, individuals who know they definitely don\u2019t want any children, and for those who can\u2019t use other types of contraception. It\u2019s also a good method for those who are absolutely sure they do not want any more children. Becoming sterilized is a serious decision that should be considered permanent. Talk to your health care provider or gynecologist if you\u2019re considering female sterilization. It\u2019s important to think about the benefits and risks and have all of your questions answered before making your final decision. If you chose to be sterilized the type of procedure will be based on your medical needs and when you want to have it done. Some individuals are sterilized right after they have a baby or an abortion, while many others choose another time.", "docid": "msmarco_doc_11_24543748"}

Arabica beans are pricier and tend to make better quality coffee, while robusta beans are cheaper and simpler to grow.\nMany brands mix the two types of beans together to increase the caffeine content in the coffee without changing the flavor.\nBrazil is the top producer of coffee, followed closely by Vietnam, Indonesia, and Columbia.\nIt is important to take into account how you normally take your coffee because this can impact the taste.\nFor instance, if you normally take your coffee with cream and sugar, you may not mind the taste of a lower quality coffee, while people who take their coffee black will be more aware of its flavor profile.\nWhen brewing your coffee, look for a coffee maker that reaches anywhere from 195 degrees to 205-degree Fahrenheit. This will help get the best tasting coffee from the beans, while avoiding a bitter aftertaste.\nGrinding your coffee beans at home can also help extra the best flavor from the coffee beans.\nBrewing Methods\nDrip Method \u2013 This is how coffeemakers make coffee. Paper filters are used to put pre-ground coffee into a cartridge and then hot water is dripped or poured over them to produce a cup or pot of coffee.\nFrench Press \u2013 This brewing method involves \u201cpressing\u201d coffee grounds to the bottom of a container to help get the most flavor out of the coffee used.\nCold Brewing \u2013 This involves steeping coffee beans or grounds in water for 12 to 24 hours before roasting them. This helps the beans become less bitter. This is best for coffee beans with lower acidity levels.\nRoasts with the Most\nRoasting coffee beans is what turns beans into the best tasting coffee that is ready to grind and brew for consumption.

Choosing a local roaster over a grocery store can provide you with a noticeably different coffee flavor.\nThese roasters are passionate about what they do and can often tell you the exact date the beans were roasted, where the beans are from, and the notes and undertones of the beans.\nAsk around and you will be surprised at how many local roasters you can find near you.\nYou will also have the added benefit of supporting a local brand and keeping the passion for coffee alive.\nOrdering Online\nIf you do not have any local coffee roasters or farmer's markets you frequent, your next best bet is to buy your coffee beans online.\nWhen shopping online, look for websites that say that they do not roast their beans until you place your order.\nThe later the beans are roasted, the better the flavor will be once you receive them.\nFor instance, you would not want to buy beans from a website that roast their beans two months ago and has them waiting on a shelf for you.\nInstead, it would be better if ordered them on a Friday, they could roast them on Saturday and ship them to you on Sunday.\nWhere Not to Buy\nJust as there are places that are better to buy better coffee, there are places you should avoid if you are looking for the freshest, best quality coffee.\nSome of these include:\nGrocery Stores\nGrocery stores are known for having longer shelf lives for coffee (up to one year for some brands). They also carry lower quality brands because it is cheaper to buy as a wholesale product.\nThe exception to this is artisan stores such as Whole Foods or Sprouts, where they typically have coffee experts that brew coffee in-house. Here, you can look for bags that include the roasting date, type of beans, and expiration date.\nA freshly brewed coffee will not typically have a very long shelf life and that is the way it should be to take advantage of the maximum flavor capabilities.\nAmazon\nMany of the products sold on Amazon are kept in warehouses and sit there for long periods of time. Even if the product is listed as \"Freshly Roasted\", it could have been roasted six months ago, so be aware of what you are purchasing if freshness is what you are looking for.\nTips for Tasting Coffee\nIf you are a beginner at coffee tasting, it might seem silly to read about all the different notes contained within different coffee beans, but this can be the best part about trying different coffees.\nThe easiest way to learn how to describe the flavors of coffee is to know what types of flavors to look for and match to the coffee you are tasting.\nBelow are some examples of questions you can ask yourself:\nSweetness - Is there a sugary or syrupy quality to the coffee? Does it have a maple flavor or more like candy? Does it taste like molasses, honey, brown sugar, or white sugar?\nBody - What does the weight feel like after a sip? Is it light or heavy? An easy comparison for this is the difference in mouth feel when drinking skim milk versus whole milk.\nAcidity - Does it have a \"zing\" in flavor? Is it more like the taste of a lemon or a grapefruit?\nFlavor - What notes do you taste? Is it chocolatey? Fruity? Smoky? Tangy?\nFinish - This takes place after your coffee sip is done. What is your last impression of it? Is it sweet? Does it coat your mouth? Is it dry?\nYouTube\nConsumer Reports\n351K subscribers\nSubscribe\nBest-tasting Coffee | Consumer Reports\nWatch later\nCopy link\nInfo\nShopping\nTap to unmute\nIf playback doesn't begin shortly, try restarting your device.\nYou're signed out\nVideos you watch may be added to the TV's watch history and influence TV recommendations.

Efficient and well-designed lighting can yield household energy savings.\nProjected average home energy use in 2012 \u2014 actual energy use varies from state to state (particularly with climate) and from home to home depending on the lighting in the home and how it is used.\nHousehold energy use\n%\nSource: DEWHA. 2008\nHeating and cooling\n40\nWater heating\n21\nAppliances and equipment including refrigeration and cooking\n33\nLighting\n6\nAim to light your home to:\nprovide a safe, comfortable, visually appealing and desirable environment\nbe as energy efficient as possible.\nDesign for light\nThoughtful lighting design combines many daylighting and electric lighting strategies to optimise the distribution of light inside the building. It considers whole building energy impacts to minimise the building\u2019s overall energy usage and integrates the design of daylight entry (through windows and skylights) with electric lighting, including controls. It takes advantage of shading strategies and glazing technologies to moderate the intensity and spectrum of the daylight admitted to the home, to minimise heat gain during the cooling season and heat loss during the heating season. It chooses the best window aperture sizes, glazing and shading design for each orientation to reflect the expected solar angles, heat gain and glare criteria (see Passive design; Design for climate; Orientation; Shading; Glazing; Skylights).\nEffective lighting design means putting light where it\u2019s wanted and needed, and reducing or eliminating light elsewhere.\nDaylighting design aspects\nThe science of \u2018daylighting\u2019 deliberately uses daylight to reduce or negate the need for electric light. Sources of daylight include sunlight, which is an intensely bright, directional beam, and skylight, a diffuse light of about one-tenth the illumination of sunlight. Daylight is dynamic, constantly changing its characteristics (intensity, colour, direction).\nDesign your new home to not require electric lighting during daylight hours.\nA goal of all new homes should be to not require any electric lighting during daylight hours. Siting, orientation and size of the home come into play but every consideration should be given to minimising reliance on electric lighting during daylight hours.\nDone correctly, daylighting design can deliver a net saving on energy consumed by the building. Done incorrectly, it most commonly increases the heat load on the home and its cooling energy consumption. If the daylight control system is poorly implemented, building occupants have to deal with glare and/or thermal discomfort using the most expedient means at hand (e.g. curtains drawn, operating air conditioner), which in turn negates any benefit that daylighting might have offered (see Passive design; Shading).\nSome principles for daylighting in Australia\nNorth facing windows introduce sunlight and daylight into the home, particularly in winter when the sun is lower in the sky and direct sunlight contributes to heating the house.\nSouth facing windows (for latitudes below the tropic of Capricorn) predominantly introduce daylight without heat gains of direct sunlight \u2014 making them an ideal orientation for houses in warmer climates where home cooling is the main imperative.\nSkylights and light tubes of appropriate sizing and design can let in light without adding heat in summer or losing warmth in winter.\nExternally reflected daylight contains less heat than direct penetrating sunlight (i.e. the infrared heat is predominantly absorbed by natural and built environments).\nLight coloured interior surfaces reflect more light and reduce the level of artificial lighting required.\nClerestories (with the associated eaves appropriately sized) are very effective at delivering daylight to the core areas of a home.\nSunny locations can exploit tubular daylighting devices \u2014 tubular skylights \u2014 which send direct-beam sunlight into the space below and are capable of delivering very high illumination levels when the sky is clear.\nDirect sun should be excluded from task areas (particularly polished surfaces including kitchen benches and desktops) because of the high potential for glare and discomfort.\nInternal sun penetration can be controlled with the least impact on an external view by vertical blinds on predominantly east and west oriented windows and horizontal blinds for predominantly northern (and southern, for north of the tropic of Capricorn) oriented windows.\nPhoto: Bart Maiorana\nAppropriate electric lighting at night complements daylighting.\nPassive daylighting tips\nTo light task areas effectively, direct natural lighting from windows, skylights or light tubes (see Skylights) must be close to the task area. Windows should be part of the perimeter wall of the room being lit and skylights should be located in the roof directly above the task area to be lit.\nEffective natural lighting is close to task areas.\nLight tubes can be purchased for as little as $100 and installed easily by a tradesperson or capable DIY owner. They can replace a 60W light running for up to 8 hours a day in a poorly lit room, saving as much as $30 per year. They can thus pay for themselves in less than 5 years (varies according to length of use and combined wattage of lights on switch circuit).\nLight tubes can replace a 60W light running for up to 8 hours a day in a poorly lit room.\nLight shelves reflect daylight to penetrate deep into a building. They are suitable for north and south elevations but not the flat sun angles of east and west. A horizontal overhang with a high reflectance upper surface is placed above eye-level to reflect daylight onto a light coloured ceiling and deeper into a space.\nBy varying the height, angle and internal or external projection of a light shelf, you can control the pattern, intensity and depth of penetration of natural light (including sunlight) within a space. Light shelves should be light in colour and require frequent cleaning.\nNot only do light shelves allow light to penetrate deeper into the room, they can shade near the windows to reduce window glare or create a sun patch. Exterior shelves generally provide more effective shade while interior shelves provide deeper reflected light. A combination of exterior and interior shelves works best to give an even illumination gradient.\nGlass bricks are a useful source of daylight in walls that are close to boundaries or need privacy. Glass brick panels let in diffuse daylight while maintaining sound and visual privacy, and fire ratings.\nGlass bricks let in diffuse daylight while maintaining sound and visual privacy in walls that are close to boundaries or face the street.\nLight shelves reflect light deeper into rooms.\nElectric lighting design aspects\nUse of electric lighting in the home has two aspects: specific task lighting and creating a night-time ambience for a room or space.\nHuman vision has a very high dynamic range but perception of brightness shifts with the overall brightness of the entire space. The eyes adapt to low light levels at night and it is unnecessary to try to duplicate the high level of illumination available from daylight.\nWhen considering lighting a space, work on points of interest within. The human eye is attracted to bright objects and accordingly should be rewarded with something of interest. By contrast, dark areas are of limited attraction but serve to accentuate (by contrast) the brighter objects of interest. Use highlights (about 10 times the ambient light level) to draw attention to key objects or spaces in a room, or for lighting specific tasks. Carefully select features to highlight (e.g. artwork, sculptures, and furniture items) and use the minimum effective highlight level so you don\u2019t waste energy.\nReading lamps or table lamps are an effective, flexible and efficient means of giving higher task lighting rather than increasing general lighting of the entire space. They can also be part of the accent lighting for mood setting (e.g. table lamp on side table in lounge room).\nApplications for electric lighting\nPlan your lighting to complement your lifestyle. Consider the activities that occur in each room, the atmosphere you want to create and the decorative elements you want to highlight.\nConsider in particular the areas that serve more than one purpose and require more than one style of lighting (e.g. relaxed entertaining, media viewing, reading/writing, general activity). Use separate lighting solutions and circuits for each function rather than integrating them into a single circuit. Lights may need to be on separate switches, and/or dimmers used to create the lighting desired.\nEach lamp type has advantages and disadvantages and good design uses an appropriate type for each application.\nRemember:\nLight is heavily absorbed (wasted) in dark-coloured rooms.\nLight can be indirectly reflected (i.e. cove and pelmet lighting) to create very subtle background illumination but only in light-coloured rooms/surfaces.\nThere is no \u2018best\u2019 lamp for all applications. Of the many alternatives, each has advantages and disadvantages: good design uses an appropriate lamp/light fixture for each application.\nThe various lamp technologies generate light differently. Choose lamps best suited to producing desired lighting effects such as light distribution, switch-on time and dimmability.\nFor example, some compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) take a few seconds to strike and \u2018warm up\u2019, and are thus unsuitable where use may only be for a few seconds (e.g. kitchen pantry) or where lights are switched on and off quickly. CFL lamps, although efficient, are an inferior choice in these rooms to tungsten halogen or even LEDs, although LEDs may not have the cost benefit for such short uses.\nMost rooms need two types of lighting: general lighting and task/accent lighting. Use different lamps and light fittings for each purpose.\nGeneral/ambient lighting\nAmbient lighting provides overall, general lighting that radiates a comfortable level of brightness. A central source of ambient light in all rooms is fundamental to a good lighting plan.\nUse omni-directional (light in all directions) lamps in pendants, chandeliers, ceiling or wall-mounted fixtures.\nAvoid using downlights for general illumination. They make bright \u2018pools\u2019 of light on the floor (most floor surfaces absorb as much as 80% of the light) while making the ceiling cavity appear dark, which creates a \u2018gloomy\u2019 ambience. Downlights are better suited to task lighting over work spaces. Up to 6 downlights can be needed to light the same area as one pendant light. Think about other ways of lighting with fluorescent omni-directional lamps before installing downlights or if used, fit lower wattage and more efficient bulbs.\nChoose light fittings and lamp shades that allow most of the light through so a lower wattage lamp can be used. Some light fittings can block or absorb 50% or more of light.\nPhoto: Steve Coyne\nDirectional light fittings complement ambient lighting.\nTask/accent lighting\nTask lighting is used to illuminate specific tasks such as reading, sewing, cooking, homework, games or hobbies. Accent lighting adds drama to a room by creating visual interest. It can emphasise paintings, house plants and collectables, or highlight the texture of a wall, drapery or outdoor landscaping.\nDirectional lamps or downlights, such as LED or halogen reflector lamps, are best employed for this purpose.\nUse desk/table/floor lamps in areas where the activity or furniture is likely to change positions (lounge, dining, bedrooms)\nWhere illuminated task surfaces will not change (e.g. over kitchen benches), use fixed directional lighting.\nMake sure task lighting is free of distracting glare and shadows but bright enough to prevent eye strain.\nKey points for selecting the appropriate beam angle for directional lamps:\nBeam angle is the angle at which light intensity drops to 50% of centre beam intensity. Virtually all (around 90%) light from a directional lamp is in the beam and very little light reaches other surfaces outside the path of the beam.\nBasic rule: for the same wattage lamp, the smaller the beam angle the brighter the surface illuminated but the smaller the area illuminated.\nSelect the appropriate beam angle by determining the largest dimension of the feature to be lit and the distance from it. The packaging of most directional lamps generally shows a simple graphic to help select the appropriate beam angle.\n\u00ce\u00a6 luminous flux (the perceived power of light)\nAt the beam angle light intensity drops to 50% of centre beam intensity.\nChoosing lamps\nColour of light\nTwo ratings are used to describe the colour of white light sources:\ncorrelated colour temperature (CCT)\ncolour rendering index (CRI).\nCCT, measured on the Kelvin (K) temperature scale, describes the \u2018shade\u2019 of white light emitted.\nCommon colour temperatures and their typical uses\nCCT (K)\nColour designation\nAppearance\nTypical uses\n2,700-3,200\nWarm white\nSimilar to incandescent\nHousehold rooms\n4100\nCool white\nNeutral light\nOffices, garages, workshops\n5,500-6,500\nDaylight\nCold, harsh, unrelaxed light\nBathrooms, laundries\nThe material and colour of your furniture can play a role in your decision to use warm or cool lights, since the variation of lighting colour can make room colours appear very vibrant or quite dull.\nCorrelated colour temperature\nUnit: Kelvin\nRole: scale to describe how \u2018warm\u2019 or \u2018cool\u2019 the light source appears\nOrigin: in theory, as an object (e.g. piece of metal) is heated, it glows, changing colour from a red to orange to yellow to white to bluish-white as the temperature increases.\nCCT of typical residential lamps:\nIncandescent lamps: operate by heating the filament to 2,700K and by definition, have a colour temperature of 2,700K\nFluorescent, CFL and LED lights: available in a wide range of colour temperatures.\nCool white (left) and warm white (right) colour temperature lamps give rooms a different appearance.\nMatch the lamp\u2019s colour temperature to the tones of your room. Warm colour temperatures render warm colours like reds, yellows and browns well; cool colour temperatures render cool colours like greys, greens and blues better. In rooms following these general rules, furnishings appear more vibrant. If you have a mix of furnishings, use lamps that produce light in approximately the 3,500K range.\nNo matter what colour temperature light you choose, if it has a low colour rendering index, nothing will look good under it.\nColour rendering index\nUnit: none\nRole: scale between 100 and below 0 where 100 represents true natural colour reproduction for that particular colour temperature\nOrigin: a reference source such as sunlight is defined as having a CRI of 100; incandescent lamps radiate a similar spectrum of light to the sun\nCCT of typical residential lamps:\nIncandescent lamps: 100 Fluorescent, CFL lamps: 60-95 LED lamps: 80-90\nThe colour rendering index rates the portrayal of colour.\nCRI rates the ability of the light to accurately portray colours of objects in the space being lit.\nA CRI of higher than 80 is usually adequate but for specialised tasks where colour is important (food preparation, applying makeup, painting) it is advisable to choose lamps with a CRI above 90.\nLamps of the same colour temperature can vary in their ability to render colours correctly.\nExpand your definition of cost\nBuyer decisions are often driven by the price tag on an item, without regard for lifetime costs. Lamp technologies differ fundamentally in their lifetime and power consumption, and both have a significant impact on the true cost of providing light over an extended period. For example, at present the initial price of a halogen lamp is significantly lower than the price of an equivalent LED lamp but an LED lasts 5 to 10 times longer and consumes one-fifth the energy. The true dollar cost thus favours LED. The graph analysis for replacement lamp alternatives to a 75W tungsten filament incandescent lamp (no longer available) shows a starting cost of the price of a lamp, each step representing the replacement cost for another lamp, and the rising continuous line indicating the electricity costs of running the lamp.\nNote All lamps have equivalent light output. Banned 75W incandenscent for reference only\nOperating and replacements costs for lamp technologies, based on lifetime and price of 25,000 hours and $50 for LED, 8,000 hours and $6 for CFL, 2,000 hours and $4 for halogen, and 1,000 hours and $1 for incandescent lamps; and electricity rate of $0.2275/kWh.\nThe lamp use of 5 hours per day as the basis for the graph is typical for commonly used areas such as kitchens and lounge rooms (based on 2012 Residential Energy Monitoring Program, Lighting data collection and analysis study .) In rooms with fewer hours of use, the cost shown on the graph will decrease by the same proportion (e.g. half the hours of use per day: half the cost at each point in time).\nThis type of analysis can be extended to look at the cost for particular lighting arrangements for each room. The table compares three lighting designs for a 5 x 5m living room with four feature items that could be highlighted, for 5 hours operation a day.\nReplacement costs for three lighting designs (does not include cost of fittings)\nDesign\nAmbient lighting\nAccent lighting\nTotal wattage\nInitial lamp cost\nAnnual running cost\nA\n9 x 50W MR16 halogen\nnil\n~ 450W\nUnder $50\n~ $200\nB\n1 x 72W halogen\n4 x 20W MR16 halogen\n~ 150W\nUnder $50\n~ $70\nC\n1 x 23W CFL\n4 x 6W MR16 LED\n~ 50W\n$200\n~ $25\nSwitches and controls\nTime of use, hours of use, and occupancy of and traffic through spaces vary in the home. Switches and controls can be a very effective method of providing lighting only when and where it is required.\nSome basic principles:\nProvide multiple switches to control different lighting elements (ambient, accent or task) in a room where all may not be required all the time. One switch to turn on all lights in a large room is very inefficient. When choosing switching groups always begin with lighting that is needed most, such as that over the kitchen benches, then work backward. Place switches at exits from rooms and use two-way switching (for long hallways or stairwells) to encourage lights to be turned off when leaving the space.\n\u2018Smart\u2019 light switches and fittings use movement sensors to turn lights on and off automatically. These are useful in rooms used infrequently where lights may be left on (for very long times) by mistake, or for children, the elderly and people with disabilities. Built-in daylight sensors make sure the light doesn\u2019t turn on unnecessarily during daylight hours.\nUse timers, daylight controls and motion sensors to switch outdoor security lights on and off automatically. Similar controls are particularly useful for common areas, such as hallways, corridors and stairwells, in multi-unit housing. Some controls are not compatible with particular lamp types so seek advice.\nConsider using solar powered lighting for garden and sensor security lights.\nModern dimmer controls save energy and also increase lamp life. However, reducing light output to 50% saves only about 25% of the energy (for a halogen lamp). If you dim some lights most of the time, consider replacing them with lower wattage lamps.\nMost standard fluorescent and LED lamps cannot be dimmed (although this is improving), but special dimmers and lamps are available (check packaging or manufacturer\u2019s website for information). When installing new light fittings and controls, check on compatibility.\nSource: https://cnsorlight.en\nSwitch with passive infrared sensor.\nLamp technology selection summary\nNon-directional lamps\n\n\nQuality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBulb Type\nBulb Image\nLamp Colour Range\nPrice\nEfficacy (lumens/W)\nQuantity of light (lumens)\nLight distribution\nLifetime (hours)\nColour rendering\nDimmable\nLED\n\n\n> $20\n20-40\nmed\nvaries\n15-50k\nexcellent\nmany dim\nCFL\n\n\n$5-20\n> 40\nhigh\nsphere\n5-20k\nexcellent\nfew dim\nCCFL\n\n\n> $20\n20-40\nmed\nsphere\n5-20k\nexcellent\nmany dim\nLinear & circular fluoro\n\n\n$5-20\n> 40\nvery high\nsphere\n> 20k\nexcellent\nfew dim\nInduction\n\n\n> $20\n> 40\nhigh\nhemi\n> 20k\ngood\nfew dim\nHalogen\n\n\n< $5\n< 20\nhigh\nsphere\n< 5k\nexcellent\nall dim\nLED is a rapidly developing technology; prices are decreasing while performance is improving; CCFL: cold cathode fluorescent lamp.\nDirectional lamps\n\n\nQuality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBulb type\nBulb Image\nLamp Colour Range\nPrice\nEfficacy (lumens/W)\nAvailable light output\nBeam control & range of beam angles\nLifetime\nColour rendering\nDimmable\nLED\n\n\n> $20\n> 40\nmed\ngood\n20k\nexcellent\nmany dim\nCFL\n\n\n$5-20\n20-40\nmed\npoor\n5-20k\nexcellent\nfew dim\nCCFL\n\n\n$5-20\n20-40\nlow\npoor\n5-20k\nexcellent\nmany dim\nHalogen\n\n\n< $5\n< 20\nhigh\ngood\n< 5k\nexcellent\nall dim\nIn Australia, only incandescent, CFL and linear fluorescent lamps are regulated for energy efficiency and light quality. Other lamp technologies can vary greatly in quality. Read packaging information and technical specifications carefully to ensure the product is suitable for your intended use.\nRegulations\nLighting energy efficiency requirements are regulated through Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for specific lighting products. Lighting installations in new homes must comply with the requirements of the Building Code of Australia (BCA). Important safety aspects of electric lighting are also covered by Australian Standards.\nMinimum Energy Performance Standards\nIn Australia, for most residential lamp technologies (incandescent, CFL and linear fluorescent lamps) inefficient lamps have been phased out and MEPS are in place, which cover aspects of energy efficiency and light quality. For more information see the Energy Rating website: www.energyrating.gov.au.\nBuilding Code of Australia\nThe BCA addresses lighting on: the installed power density of artificial lighting and associated controls; heat gains and losses from reduced coverage of ceiling insulation due to downlight and skylight installations; and access to daylight through windows.\nSince May 2011, any new home or significant renovation of an existing home must have an aggregate lamp power density of hard-wired electric lighting that does not exceed specified values, which may be reviewed from year to year. Concessions to this rule exist for certain lighting controls depending on their application (BCA Vol 2, Part 3.12.5.5).\nFor effective minimisation of heat gains and losses in homes, ceiling insulation should ideally form a continuous thermal barrier between the interior spaces of the house and the exterior (see Insulation installation). Each skylight and recessed light fitting, such as a downlight, introduced into the ceiling space creates a \u2018hole\u2019 in the insulation barrier. The high operating temperatures of many lamps also demand a fire safety requirement for an additional space between each light fitting and the edge of the insulation to prevent risk of fire (AS/NZS3000:2007, Electrical installations).\nThermal losses through these breaks in a home\u2019s insulation will ultimately increase energy costs for household heating and cooling. The BCA includes a requirement that the minimum thermal resistance of the chosen insulation material be increased to help combat these losses, depending on the percentage of ceiling area that is uninsulated (BCA Vol 2, Part 3.12.1.1b). Also to be considered are:\nprovision of light to habitable rooms including minimum area for windows and skylights (BCA Vol 2, Part 3.8.4)\nexternal glazing performance and shading (BCA Vol 2, Part 3.12.2).\nTop 10 steps to lighting\nDesign a house to not need lights turned on during daylight hours.\nConsider the orientation and layout of rooms to best use available daylight.\nUse surface reflectance of light coloured surfaces, and well positioned pendant and wall lights, for good light distribution in a room.\nDecide the type or types (e.g. general lighting, mood/background lighting, task lighting) of ambience you wish to create in each room during night-time use.\nFor more than one type of ambience, adjust light levels (dim lights) or turn different lights on or off through different switching circuits.\nCreate task or accent lighting with directional lighting.\nCreate general lighting with non-directional lighting.\nUse warm coloured lamps for the home, except possibly for bathrooms and laundries where the cooler coloured lamps present an appearance of a clean, sterile space.\nBefore selecting a lamp, identify relevant attributes for illuminating each room (e.g. quick start-up, long life lamp, dimmable, multi-way switching).\nFor getting the \u2018right amount of light\u2019 to create the ambience you want, think about lumens, which measure of the total amount of visible light emitted by a source, not wattage (power).\nReferences and additional reading\nDepartment of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA). 2008.

It is an even wood piece which has notable elastic, slender fingers on the other side of the plane.\nThere is a concrete reason why it is called the featherboard. It is basically a board that has a string of fingers formed on the other end of it that motions much like a feather.\nThe purpose of these fingers is to give steady force to clasp the stock steadfastly alongside fences and tabletops. The angle permits stock to go through in a linear course while simultaneously refusing to go along with the motion in the opposed track.\nA good way to utilize this is when using it conjunction with motionless power cutting devices such as router table, radial arm saw and the table saw.\nMore...\nMeanwhile, this board provides enhancement on the usage of shaper cuts and routers. This is done through retaining the force precisely wherever it is required.\nConsequently, this provides the section being worked on to remain going in a steady, straight path. This is specifically useful for calculating thin stock carefully which is a specific dilemma when supplying stock with hand.\nWhile being fastened to the table of the motionless device, the bendable fingers are strategically placed to clutch to the workpiece securely for the duration of the rip cuts. This is to make sure that a smooth cut is done while it goes through the cutting edge.\nTable of Contents [ show]\nUses of the Featherboard\nWhere to Find Featherboards?\nGetting Comfortable With the Featherboard\nConclusion\nUses of the Featherboard\nThere are several procedures that a featherboard can be utilized for. Considered as a customary piece in just about every woodworking store, featherboards are ultimately versatile.\nIt can be used for:\nCreating molding for router tables\nEdge jointing\u00b7\nSteering stock as it goes through the cutting edge\nHelpful as a protective accessory\nThese are just some of the reasons why you could not go without any featherboard during any woodworking projec\ufefft.\nWhere to Find Featherboards?\nTo avoid any critical injury while doing a woodworking task, it is best to purchase a featherboard before starting any project.\nBefore purchasing anything, it helps to note what you would be using the featherboard for. There are different sizes and shapes that are available specific to a task they are going to be employed for.\nAlso, featherboards can be commercially made or may be homemade. Any type will function just as similarly.\nIf you opt to buy a commercial featherboard, it is helpful to look for it in online woodworking shops and woodworking superstores. In contrast, homemade featherboards can be done simply through cutting a sequence of fingers only on one area of an even plank incised at an angle on the last part.\nApart from where the featherboards are from, you might want to consider the durability, the reliability, and the pricing prior to finally buying one.\nGetting Comfortable With the Featherboard\nFor it to be an effective safety piece, a featherboard must be used with both ease and precision. With that said, the woodworker must know how to use it.\nTo start, there are a few things to remember so you can get comfortable with the featherboard. Foremost, know the space between the expected blockade of the saw bench blade and the position of the featherboard. This distance must be accurately recognized.\nProceed with switching off and unplugging of the saw bench. Put the stock wood that is going to be incised alongside the saw blade barrier. Thereafter, you can put the featherboard in opposition to the stock.\nEnsure that the fit must be at ease for the wood to be pressed through. This is a consideration that the woodworker is permitted to remain in total command over the motion of the wood for each time it passes through.\nIt is intended that a featherboard is cut at a certain angle to provide the most excellent probable surface area intended for the timber to go through the saw. The little end part of the board must constantly be looking at the last part of the table saw.\nThis is the location where a woodworker must be situated. This is so in order for the woodworker to thrust the stock wood all the way through the blade. On the other hand, the featherboard fingers operate as a cushion to permit the wood to go through the cutting edge securely.\nThis can be achieved by having the woodworker employ the shoving movement and never forgetting that fingers should in no way come near the blade location.\nTo have the featherboard functioning properly, utilize clamps and put it into its proper place. Ensure two clamps are utilized in the board so that it is safe. In the event that the clamps are in place, attempt to feed stock which needs to be cut. If the stock is thin, this is extremely helpful.\nThe woodworker ,in turn, can manage the wood being incised. In this situation, utilizing a carving tool in this location is encouraged. In the moment that the stock passes through effortlessly, you can now be confident that proper stock placement is definitely set up.\nAlso, the feathers on the board will put a stop any possible recoil. To continue with the woodworking task at hand, you may opt to use a masking tape so you can mark an impermanent point for the accurate position.\nContinue the process up until the desired wood shape or size is achieved.\nConclusion\nWhen working with wood, it is vital that safety is being certainly considered.
