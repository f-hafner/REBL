Back to video\nWith varying degrees of colour and flavour intensity, the type of brown sugar you should choose to use depends entirely on what you want to do with it. The darker the sugar, the more of a deep, rich, earthy molasses flavour it will have. Since molasses is intense and can easily overpower other ingredients in a recipe, some recipes call for one type of brown sugar over others.\nGenerally speaking, \u201cgolden\u201d brown sugar has a light, delicate flavour without the heavy molasses notes of darker brown sugars. Regular brown sugar is dark and moist and is used for tasks where you want more of a molasses kick. Demerara sugar is darker still, with large crystals that give it a crunchy texture. There\u2019s a helpful guide to the ubiquitous Rogers line of brown sugars on their website.\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nUnless otherwise noted in a recipe, you can use one type of brown sugar in place of another, as long as you remember that using a darker sugar will have a more pronounced effect on the overall flavour, and that the texture of baked goods may differ depending on which you choose. All can be used for things like sweetening coffee, where a rich and sticky demerara can elevate an ordinary cup of dark roast coffee into something quite extraordinary.\nDon\u2019t confuse brown sugar for \u201craw\u201d or \u201cplantation\u201d sugar, which is typically not soft. Using this in place of brown sugar in baking will change your results.\nSome natural foods stores carry unrefined brown sugars, including types like muscovado. While these can be delicious, recipes may not turn out exactly as expected, either due to a different texture or a lower level of sweetness in the same volume of sugar. If you plan to bake with these sugars, it may take some experimentation in the kitchen unless the recipe was specifically designed for their use.\n\u2014\nWe Can Help! is a weekly column from ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen.

Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\nArticle content\nQuestion: When grilling, do I leave the lid open or closed?\nAnswer: This depends on what you\u2019re cooking, the size/type of your barbecue and the weather outside.\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\nTry refreshing your browser, or\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\nWhen grilling, do I leave the lid open or closed? Back to video\nIn a professional restaurant kitchen setting, where taste matters more than energy efficiency, chefs typically cook steaks on a grill that has no lid. They use them to grill chicken, sausages, salmon and pretty much anything else that requires even heat for a relatively short time. These grills are much more powerful than a home barbecue, allowing them to reach high heat without requiring an enclosed space.\nIn a home setting, where you\u2019re as concerned about the energy bill as the taste of your meal, cooking with an open lid can seem needlessly wasteful. An open lid means lost heat, which means more gas is required to maintain the temperature of the grill. The energy incentive of closed-lid cooking seems obvious, in the same way you keep an oven door closed when baking a cake and the door of the house closed during the middle of an Alberta winter.\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nBut in practice, it\u2019s not that simple.\nThere are reasons to cook with the lid open, at least in certain circumstances. Trapping heat inside your barbecue makes it cook more like an oven than a grill; that\u2019s fine if you want to use your barbecue as an oven to bake a pie or roast a chicken, but it\u2019s not ideal if you want to use it for many of the things an oven can\u2019t do.\nWith the lid open, you get precise control over the heat hitting one surface of your food; with the lid closed, you still have the heat acting on the bottom of the food, but it also picks up heat from the air surrounding it, which can lead to mixed results. For example, closing the lid means you can\u2019t get the same quality sear on both sides of a steak, as the top will already be partially cooked by the time the steak is flipped.\nAfter a chat with our chef instructors and home economists, we\u2019ve compiled a list of cooking scenarios where either a closed lid or an open lid on the barbecue would be ideal:\nClosed Lid:\n\u2013 Pizza on a baking stone\n\u2013 Anything baked (pies, crumbles, etc.)\n\u2013 Preheating the grill\n\u2013 Indirect cooking\n\u2013 Cooking a whole chicken\n\u2013 Smoking something with a smoke box\n\u2013 Grilling large pieces of meat like a turkey, roast, leg of lamb, etc.\n\u2013 Anything that falls under the proverbial \u201clow-and-slow\u201d grilling technique\n\u2013 Food cooked on a rotisserie\nOpen Lid:\n\u2013 Burgers\n\u2013 Steaks\n\u2013 Hot dogs\n\u2013 Shrimp, prawns, zucchini planks and other small things that could easily be ruined by overcooking\n\u2013 Kebabs\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nKeep in mind the heat/intensity of your grill, along with adverse weather conditions, may make cooking on an open grill difficult. Your barbecue must be able to generate enough consistent heat to cook food thoroughly one side at a time. If you\u2019re struggling with this, know that a clean barbecue makes better use of its heating power.\nMake sure you check the internal temperature of anything you grill; if using your grill with the lid open means you can\u2019t easily reach the correct internal temperature, cook items with the lid closed instead.\n\u2014\nWe Can Help! is a weekly column from ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen.

Of course, the most important factor is location, and this means the lot itself, the neighbourhood, the city and the province. What can be tricky is deciding if a \u201cpremium\u201d lot offered by the builder is actually worth the extra cost, and if it will improve your value when the time comes to sell.\nPie lot:\nMost pie shaped lots are definitely worth the premium price \u2013 you get way more space than your neighbours, and more space between yourself and your neighbours. One downside is there tends to be less space for visitors to park, and there is generally not enough space between driveways for street parking. Another benefit though is that you have very little sidewalk to shovel in the winter. On the other hand, a reverse pie lot (where your front yard is wider than your back yard) is typically less desirable than a regular rectangular lot.\nLot orientation:\nMost people prefer a lot where the back yard faces south, west or somewhere in between. This means you get the sun in your back yard for most of the day. You often seen owners of homes that have back yards facing north or east sitting in their front yards or driveways in the afternoons \u2013 a friend of mine calls them \u201cgarage people.\u201d\nGreen space:\nA lot that backs onto green space is almost always worth a premium price. You have much more privacy, since your neighbours are so much further away. However, not all green spaces are created equal. Make sure you look into the restrictive covenants with regards to fences; some neighbourhoods require that the fencing along a green space be chain link. If you\u2019re on a fairly narrow green space with chain link fences, you actually end up with less privacy than you would backing onto other homes with a wooden fence. Siding onto green space gives you a little more space between you and your next door neighbour, but there will be foot traffic along the whole length of your lot\nCorner lot:\nCorner lots have to be assessed on a case by case basis as they can be more or less valuable depending on the situation. If you\u2019re on a corner lot siding onto a busy street it\u2019s less valuable. A definite downside to corner lots is sidewalk maintenance \u2013 in most cases you will have 3-4 times as much shovelling to do in the winter as your neighbours have to do on rectangular lots. However, in some cases the sidewalk along the side of your home is maintained by the city. So a corner lot, on a quiet street, with city maintenance can be quite valuable. In a city where it snows for half the year, shovelling is a major consideration for most home owners.\nWalk out lot:\nIn general, a walk out lot has more value than a regular lot, but as in all cases there are some better than others. It is particularly important to find out what you back onto with a walk out lot: if you back onto a busy street or other homes your walk out home becomes a giant fishbowl towering over the neighbours for everyone to look in on. A severe slope can be less attractive to families, since kids will have to go down lots of stairs from the deck in order to play in the back yard (plus its harder to see them down there from inside the home). A shallow slope can lead what Sheldon calls an \u201calligator pit\u201d where your walk out area is actually below grade \u2013 excellent landscaping is particularly important in this case.\nRestrictive covenants:\nNo one likes to be restricted from doing what they want to do, but restrictions are generally a good thing when it comes to neighbourhoods. When you drive through a neighbourhood with no restrictions you get homes and fences in every shape, form colour and style under the sun. It usually ends up looking like a big mess. In general the more expensive the neighbourhood, the more restrictions you will find. Typical restrictions include the type and colour fencing, quality/type of exterior building materials, number and size of out buildings (garages, sheds etc), percent of coverage (how much space the home can take up on the lot), minimum number of trees, set backs, and height restrictions.\nPower lines:\nWhether you believe there are negative effects from living near power lines or not, your lot value will be lower if you\u2019re visibly close to large power lines. Perception is reality in real estate, and if power lines are the first thing a buyer sees when you\u2019re driving up to the home they will instantly discount it, if not take it off their list. The interesting thing is being just one block away can make all the difference in the world \u2013 the phrase \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d is really true in real estate.\nSo the most valuable lot in a subdivision would be a walk out pie lot, backing onto green space where the back yard faces south west and no power lines are visible.\nAbout Sara MacLennan\nSara MacLennan is the Director of Marketing at Liv Real Estate and a licensed Real Estate Associate.

The province is streaming it, as well.\nHere's a mobile version of the ScribbleLive\nPromising \"great things to come\", Alberta's fresh-faced NDP MLAs were sworn-in at the legislature on Monday.\nFamily and friends packed the visitors gallery inside the Alberta Legislature chamber as the NDP government's 52 MLAs, including new Premier Rachel Notley, were sworn-in by Alberta Chief Justice Catherine Fraser and received their MLA mace pins from Speaker Gene Zwozdesky. A whopping 48 NDP MLAs took the oath for the first time.\n\"This is without question the longest swearing-in ceremony that I've ever been in,\" joked Notley.\nThe government bench is so large that two seats spill over onto the opposition side of the house. Winning one of two NDP seats in 2008, Notley joked that \"being the two lonely naysayers in the corner is an honourable tradition.\"\n\"It means there are great things to come,\" she said. \"The new members of your legislative assembly embody hope and optimism and they bring rich and diverse experiences of Alberta life to this building.\"\nNotley hugged each of her MLAs in turn as they swore the oath of office. Medicine Hat MLA Bob Wanner even planted a kiss on Notley's cheek. Calgary-Shaw MLA Graham Sucha wore a kilt to the ceremony. An emotional Zwozdesky, who will be replaced as Speaker in a vote next week, received a standing ovation from the government benches.\nEdmonton-South West MLA Thomas Dang, the youngest MLA at 20-years-old, called the ceremony \"exciting.\"\n\"This is real. We're MLAs now. We're going to be able to make this change and bring this positive energy to Alberta.\"\nEducation Minister David Eggen said it was \"fantastic\" to see the NDP majority fully assembled for the first time.\n\"This is the muscle and the bone that makes the new government of Alberta,\" he said. \"It's very exciting.\"\nFinance Minister Joe Ceci said he was \"very grateful\" to be sworn-in, noting that only 902 Albertans have ever shared that privilege. Infrastructure and Transportation Minister Brian Mason said it was a \"nice feeling\" to sit in the government benches, noting the NDP has many young politicians.\n\"They're bright, they're committed and we're going to do our best to help them become first rate MLAs,\" he said.\nIt was a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy for Municipal Affairs Minister Deron Bilous, who said he told the Progressive Conservatives in 2012 that the NDP would be seizing the government benches one day.\n\"Of course, their response was they laughed,\" said Bilous, adding the New Democrats can learn from the PCs mistakes.\n\"It's naive if a party or person thinks they'll always be in government or on one side of the house... I think there were members from the PC party who forgot about where they came from really, who's responsible to whom.\"\n\"At the end of the day, nobody is here forever.\"\nmatthew.dykstra@sunmedia.ca\n@SunMattDykstra\n10 a.m. NDP - 52 caucus members\n1 p.m. Wildrose - 21\n2:30 p.m. PC - 9\nAlberta Party - 1*\nLiberal - 1*\nIndependent - 1*\nVacant - 1\n* to be sworn in at the Office of the Lieutenant Governor.

With 27.4 seconds left in overtime, Jennifer Wakefield scored the winner to give Canada the six-game series five games to one.\nTwice an Olympic gold medal winning goaltender, Edmonton\u2019s Szabados grabbed 32-year-old teammate Mikkelson from St. Albert, also a two-time winner of the Olympic gold, and shared emotions of the moment.\n\u201cAfter the game, I told Mikkelson: \u2018I don\u2019t want to leave. I don\u2019t want to leave the ice right now.\u2019\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content continued\n\u201cThis is probably in the top five. This is pretty incredible. I probably had 300 friends and family in the crowd tonight. I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything better.\u201d\nA crowd of 17,468 was the largest for a \u2018friendly\u2019 in Canadian women\u2019s hockey history and beat the 16,805 for the gold medal final of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games. Only a crowd of 18,023 for a round-robin game at the IIHF Women\u2019s Worlds in Ottawa in 2013 tops.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty fortunate to play in a lot of big games in this program and get used to it but this was something else tonight,\u201d said Szabados.\nMikkelson said the evening hit her just the same.\n\u201cIt was amazing. I felt exactly the same as Shannon when she came up and told me: \u2018I don\u2019t want to get off the ice. Look at this. This is unreal.\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it was. Unreal.\u201d\nTop five?\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, 10 years ago I was working at a marketing agency two or three blocks away from here and had never played for the national women\u2019s team. So driving to the rink today was a pretty incredible experience just knowing where I came from or how I got here. It was a surreal moment. I definitely would put it in the top five as well.\n\u201cJust knowing what the fans in Edmonton are like, I knew it was going to be amazing. The fans gave us that little bit of energy that we needed to put that game away.\u201d\nSzabados was asked if she had to work to take the emotion out of playing the last game of the pre-Olympic schedule against the Americans in front of such a massive gathering in her hometown, something she had to wait he entire career to experience.\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content continued\n\u201cUh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI love when there is emotion in it. I love when there is pressure in it. It\u2019s not hard to get up for a game like that when there\u2019s a crowd like that. If anything, I embrace it and use it,\u201d said the charismatic custodian of the Canadian cord cottage who increased her career record to 43-9.\nFor Szabados, it was by far the biggest crowd she\u2019d ever played before in the neighborhood where she played for teams in the AJHL and NAIT and Grant McEwen before heading to play pro in the Southern Hockey League. That was where I visited her with the Columbus Cottonmouths, playing before crowds in the 3,000-7,000 range.\n\u201cYou know, playing in the AJHL and even playing in college, it was fun to play in those smaller rinks. They were usually pretty packed and pretty loud.\u201d\nThe Canadian women, in preparing for the Olympics, are hardly strangers in coming to Edmonton to find competitive games to play.\nWhile there was big focus on what happened Sunday night in the final game of the six-game series against the USA, the Canadians go back to playing against Alberta Midget AAA opposition from now until the Olympics. The team will hang around town for two more games of their schedule, visiting St. Albert Tuesday and the Maple Leaf Athletic Club Wednesday at Bill Hunter Arena.\nWith 11,226 in Winnipeg, 9,123 in Quebec City and 6,289 in Boston, 9,098 in Saint Paul, MN., and 6,091 in San Jose, the gathering Sunday in Edmonton was a great way to send both teams home for Christmas.\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content continued\nAnd I\u2019ll guarantee you that the brain trust of the IIHF, Hockey Canada and the Oilers Entertainment Group will be looking at that 17,468 figure and think: \u201cHmmmmm, maybe the next Women\u2019s Worlds in Canada should be in Edmonton.\u201d\nSzabados said 31 isn\u2019t old for a goalie and she doesn\u2019t view this go-ropund as her last hurrah. And Mikkelson said she\u2019s not looking at the finish line yet either.\n\u201cI\u2019m 32 and I\u2019m in the best shape of my career. I\u2019m definitely not thinking about packing it in any time soon.\u201d\nThey both would love to have a do-over here with the Women\u2019s Worlds.\n\u201cThe fans in Edmonton are incredible and I\u2019ve known that for a very long time. They proved it again tonight.\u201d\ntjones@postmedia.com", "docid": "msmarco_doc_01_30776"}

The car in the left lane typically blocks your line of sight to oncoming traffic so you need to creep into the pedestrian crossing, forcing them to walk around the car, compromising their safety.\nIf the stop line for the left lane were staggered at least half a car length back with a yellow X, you could possibly have a clear line of sight to oncoming traffic, obstructions notwithstanding. This would also help prevent cars waiting in the pedestrian crossing and impeding pedestrian traffic from clearing the intersection.\nThis is already done for left-turn only lanes at many intersections to allow space for vehicles turning into the opposite lane.\nTags\nintersection\nred light\nright turn\nsafety\nAnnotations\nVoting\n0 votes\nActive\nActive\nIdea No. 121", "docid": "msmarco_doc_01_37816"}
