About 2,200 persons from throughout the mid-Atlantic region and beyond gather each year at the Hershey Lodge for the Convention when it is held in-person.\nWith the current corona virus pandemic, an in-person meeting was not possible for 2021 but our virtual 2021 Convention featured four days of educational sessions in four tracks \u2013 vegetable, tree fruit, small fruit and marketing plus 76 exhibitors in a virtual trade show. In addition, the virtual Convention was sponsored by dozens of companies usually present in the trade show.\nWhile the live virtual event is over, the virtual website and recordings of the educational sessions will be available until March 31 to anyone registered for the Convention. Registration is still open at a cost of $ 40 . Pennsylvania and Maryland growers can still earn pesticide credits from the recordings of the educational sessions.

But since it\u2019s summer and the best time to travel, we needed some new motorcycle trips. The U.S. south is too hot this time of year, so we\u2019re headed to the Pacific Northwest.\nHighway 20 Washington Pass, Washington\nThe Washington 20\nWashington state has arguably the most breathtaking mountain scenery in the United States. Highway 20 is no different. This 65 mile ride starts in Marblemount and ends in Winthrop.\nThe route takes you through North Cascade National Park, and you\u2019ll climb up to 8000 feet in elevation. The lookouts feature mountains, old growth forests, and many waterfalls. This is a trip for experienced riders: the roads are twisty with rockfall warnings.\nThe Devil\u2019s Tail, Oregon\nThe Devil\u2019s Tail in Hells Canyon\nThe Devil\u2019s Tail in Hells Canyon is one of the most famous motorcycle roads in the world. Hells Canyon is 2000 feet deeper than the Grand Canyon. The Hells Canyon Scenic Byway starts in Baker City, but the 22 mile Devil\u2019s Tail is the best part of the ride.\nThere are hundreds of twists and turns. Watch for rock falls and tar snakes. The scenery is jaw-dropping. The canyon forms the base of the Seven Devils Mountains, and you\u2019ll cross Snake River into Idaho.\nThe Klickitat Loop, Washington\nKlickitat Loop\nAnother great Washington ride is the 80 mile Klickitat Loop. Starting in Bingen, you\u2019ll head west, then ride?north and loop around to Klickitat. The best part of this ride is the lack of traffic, cops, and tourists.\nThe scenery is great, and the roads are fun. There are small lakes and mountains along the ride. Be sure to stop at the replica of Stonehenge. The roads feature?wide sweeps and nice curves.\nMount Rainier, Washington\nMount Rainier\nAnother national park in the Cascades features the dormant volcano Mount Rainier. Start your ride in Elbe and head east to Sunset Park road in the national park. This road is by far the most scenic in the park.\nYour scenery will take you through lakes and rivers, mountains and canyons, waterfalls and dropoffs. The roads are well maintained and feature many sharp turns and zig-zags. You\u2019ll climb high, as Mount Rainier sits at 14,411 feet above sea level.\nAufderheide Memorial Drive, Oregon\nAufderheide Memorial Drive\nThis 60 mile ride takes you from Oakridge, through the Willamette National Forest, and north to Rainbow, Oregon. The views are stunning, and the roads are well-kept.\nThe forests are filled with?old Douglas Firs. The rivers are brilliant blue, and the lookout at Cougar Dam is worth stopping. There\u2019s camping available, too, just make sure you\u2019re not there in the winter.\nDisqus Recommendations\nWe were unable to load Disqus Recommendations.

I know that many of you have traveled long distances to be here. Thank you all for coming to help celebrate this very special day. As I look around the room I realise how many friends Paul and Jessica have and I hope that you all have a wonderful afternoon and evening.\nToday I must admit that I am the proudest dad in the world to have accompanied Jessica today. I think that you will all agree that she looked stunning. This is where I am supposed to say a few embarrassing things about her when she was younger but as she worked with me for a time she probably knows more gossip about me than I know about her so I have called a truce. Suffice it to say that Maureen and I are both very proud of how she looks today and how she has grown up and are both delighted that she has found someone who she obviously loves and cares so much for.\nThere are two things which we as parents try to give our children, one is roots and the other is wings. Helena you have now grown your wings and fled the nest but you will still be loved all always still have roots within our family.\nIn Paul I believe that Jess has met her perfect partner. Although we have not known Paul long both Maureen and I think he is everything one could hope for in a son in law.\nMind you I knew we would get on when he took me out to the pub to ask for her hand in marriage. I remember thinking \u2018I hope he picks the hand which keeps dipping into my pocket\u2019. We shall see.\nSeriously he has many good qualities, not least of which is an ability to appreciate the finer things in life. Well, after all, he did marry our daughter didn\u2019t he?\nNow we get to the tricky part of the speech.\nAccording to the internets idiots guide to wedding speeches this is where I am supposed to give advice on the subject of marriage. Many would probably say that I am probably not the best person to do this. Perhaps the only thing I know about marriage is that it is the time when you stop painting the town and start painting walls and ceilings.\nAnyway Paul and Jess do not need my advice. The only thing I would say is that you must choose the right partner for the right reason and I think that they both have done this.\nI suppose that after 38 years of happy marriage I ought to be able to manage something a bit more constructive. Paul just remember these 3 words \u2026all, just and only. You will hear them time and again. Such as all you need to do is, its only costs so much & it will only take 5 minutes. These are all gross understatements but as a great philosopher or comedian said, women are to be loved and not understood. Mind you, helping around the house is not a bad idea. I know from the crime statistics that there has never been a case of a wife shooting her husband while he was doing the washing up.\nAfter that I had better finish but before that I would like to offer one or two final thoughts.\nMarriage is the meeting of two minds, of two hearts and of two souls. It is clear that Paul and Jessica are a perfect example of this.\nMay they be blessed with happiness that grows and with love that lasts and a peaceful life together.\nI wish them enjoyment for today, the fulfillment of all their hopes and dreams for tomorrow and love and happiness always.\nIt is now my pleasure to propose a toast to the happy couple. Please be upstanding and raise your glasses to the bride and groom Mr & Mrs Campbell.\nExample Speeches - Father of the Bride Speech #2\nGood afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen\nI did ask for an autocue for my speech today, as I have a memory like a geriatric goldfish, but I was told that the budget had been stretched to capacity and any extras would have to be paid for by myself\u2026 ( reach for piece of paper) I suddenly realised that this piece of paper is good enough!\nINTRODUCTION\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know me I\u2019m Mick, Michelle\u2019s Dad and on behalf of my wife Joan and I, I would like to welcome you all here today to celebrate the marriage of our daughter Michelle to Tony.\nI would like to welcome Tony\u2019s parents, John & Julia, his sister Annie, as well as all our relatives and friends. I know a lot of you have travelled considerable distances to be here.\nThank you all for coming to see me, it\u2019s very much appreciated.\nTHE WEDDING\nWhen I first thought about organising all of this I was quite worried about getting everything right\u2026actually I have found it all very easy\u2026You sit back and everything happens. It was just like my own wedding in 1970! I really don\u2019t know what all the fuss is about. The only thing I must say is that I was most upset that my suggestion of the local scout hut as a venue was dismissed without any consideration, however I must admit the final selection is perfectly acceptable.\nMY DAUGHTER MICHELLE\nThis is the point where I am supposed to say a few embarrassing things about Michelle when she was younger but unfortunately she has been a perfect daughter. Michelle, you\u2019ve spelt perfect wrong\u2026, anyway, she has more ammunition against me than I have about her so I have called a truce.\nSuffice it to say that Joanie and I are both very proud of how she looks today and how she has grown up and are both delighted that she has found someone who she obviously loves and cares for very much.\nI clearly remember my own wedding day being one of the proudest days of my life.\nI also clearly remember 25th July 1978\u2026look at Michelle\u2026 I was just settling down with a few beers to watch the World Cup Final between Argentina & Holland when I got a call from the hospital to say Joan had gone into in labour\u2026Luckily, the game didn\u2019t go into extra time, so I was able to set off after only 90 minutes\u2026Argentina won 3-1.\nWhen I arrived, I was handed an 8lb baby girl\u2026It was my first daughter. She was my first princess in my own Royal Family.\nIt was a fantastic, memorable day\u2026 because I had Argentina in the sweep at work.\nAs she grew up there were many milestones along the way.\nFirst steps wearing fluffy pink slippers.\nFirst day at school.\nFirst time away from home and a school trip.\nFirst falling over drunk and breaking her nose\u2026sorry, I was told not to mention the nose incident. I\u2019ve mentioned it once and I think I\u2019ve got away with it.\nThere is one particular incident that I recall that prepared me for Michelle\u2026.\nMichelle was 6 years old she went out to buy a small ice cream from the ice cream van. She returned with a double cone with strawberry and vanilla flavours, 2 flakes in the ice cream, hundreds and thousands topping sprinkled on top and the whole work of art was covered in strawberry sauce, topped off with some bubble gum inside the cone\u2026I didn\u2019t get any change and it was at this point that I realized my daughter had expensive taste.\nI remember not so long ago being told by all of my children\u2026\u2019when we get married it\u2019ll just be a small do\u2019, but luckily the ice cream incident prepared me for Michelle\u2019s ideas of small.\nMichelle has made us very proud. All parents want their children to have a good education and give themselves a good start in life. Michelle went to University and passed out\u2026not literally, I\u2019m not mentioning the nose incident again\u2026she passed with an honours degree.\nToday, I look at my daughter and I see an independent, attractive, elegant, stunning young woman. She obviously takes after her mother.\nOf course she inherits other traits from me\u2026\nher cooking\u2026\nher musical talent\u2026\nher allergy to housework\u2026\nher appreciation for the finer things in life DOWN GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE\nTONY\nEvery Father hopes his daughter will find a reliable, sensible, and considerate partner and as much as you try not to interfere in their lives, you always hope your children will make the right choices in life. Michelle chose Tony.\nI have found that Tony is reliable, sensible and considerate, especially when planning a trip to the pub, and as this closely matches my own values I think Michelle has made an excellent choice and I welcome Tony to the McNeely Clan.\nTony, I hope that you will be able to keep my daughter in the lifestyle in which she has become accustomed. I totally understand why you have chosen a career in the world of gambling!\nTo help you with your marriage, I thought I would give you some advice based on my 36 year experience of married life.\nMarriage will teach you many things\u2026 loyalty\u2026self restraint\u2026obedience\u2026I am still in daily training on these matters.\nThere is no challenge in a marriage that can\u2019t be overcome by one or more of the following:\nI was wrong!\nYou were right!\nYes Dear\nI love you!\nFinally, Never go to bed in the middle of an argument \u2013 be a man stay up and fight and watch some sport\u2026You\u2019ve lost anyway so you might as well get it over with.\nI would just like to leave you with this thought\u2026\nThe actor Richard Burton once said that \u2018a woman accepts a man for what he is and then spends the rest of her life trying to change him.\u2019\u2026 So, if we can all take one last look at Tony as we know him because Michelle\u2019s remodeling work starts first thing in the morning.\nFinally, if you would all be upstanding, I would like you all to raise a glass for the health and happiness of the bride and groom\u2026Michelle & Tony.\nExample Speeches - Father of the Bride Speech #3\nLadies and gentlemen, as father of the bride, it\u2019s my privilege to make the first speech, and I\u2019d like to start by saying what a pleasure it is to welcome you all to Karen & Peter\u2019s wedding.\nI want to welcome Peter\u2019s parents, Pauline and Alan, and all the relatives and friends of both families, and to thank you all for coming, especially those of you who have travelled great distances to be here today. It\u2019s really great to see you all.\nToday, we on the top table are surrounded by most of the friends and family who have been important to us during our lives. And by your presence today, you show your friendship and love, and bring even greater joy to this wonderful day.\nUnfortunately, we are missing two very important people however \u2013 Karen\u2019s Nanna and Grand-dad, who were unable to make the trip due to Grand-dad\u2019s ill health. We will be making a special journey north tomorrow to show them Karen in her wedding dress, and take them some pictures of the day and some cake. In the meantime, I would be grateful if you will raise your glasses in their honour - to Nanna & Grand-dad. Thank you.\nI\u2019m also pleased to formally welcome Peter into the family, although, as far as we\u2019re concerned, he\u2019s been part of the family for ages. During the time that we have known Peter, we have come to realize just how special he is to Karen \u2013 anyone can see that they\u2019re made for each other. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree they make a beautiful couple.\nA lot of effort has gone into making this the special day that Karen and Peter deserve, and I\u2019d like to make particular mention of a few of the people concerned. Peter\u2019s parents, Pauline and Alan have made a big contribution towards the success of today, and I\u2019d like to thank them for all their efforts. Also, Karen and Peter themselves have worked hard, and with great enthusiasm to make the necessary arrangements, especially for the honeymoon, which seems to have been a bit of a priority!\nI\u2019d also like to thank the staff of the Parsonage for helping to make this a special day.\nAnd there\u2019s another person who has worked tirelessly over many months to create the handmade invitations, the Orders of Service, and the menu cards, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree were fabulous. Also, her talents extended to preparing all the table decorations that you see before you. She would say that it was a labour of love, and I know how much Karen and Peter appreciate her efforts, but I\u2019d like add my thanks and propose a toast to the mother of the bride \u2013 to Susan.\nI am really fortunate that my daughter has met her Mr. Right. Of course, marriage isn\u2019t just about finding the perfect partner, but also about being one. Karen has made such a success of her life and career so far, that I\u2019m sure her marriage to Peter will be just as successful.\nSusan and I have been looking forward to this day for a long time\u2026not because we want to hand over responsibility for our daughter, but because it\u2019s a proud day for us to see Karen so happy, and so in love \u2013 and looking so beautiful today.\nBut handing Karen over to Peter reminds me of that well known theory about marriage:\nIf you love something, set it free.\nIf it comes back, it was, and will always be yours.\nIf it never returns, it was never yours to begin with.\nAnd if all it does is sit in your house, mess up your stuff, spend your money and use the telephone all night\u2026 you either married it or gave birth to it.\nMarriage is a funny thing though. Did you know that in a recent survey carried out to establish whether married man live longer than bachelors, they found that actually there\u2019s no difference. It just seems longer when you\u2019re married!\nPeter made a real impression on me when he first came into Karen\u2019s life. It was about two in the morning, and he was lying in the gutter outside our house next to a speed bump singing \u2018Angels\u2019 to\nKaren, with Andy trying to shut him up. Pity Karen wasn\u2019t at home that night to appreciate it.\nBut Peter\u2019s a great lad, only problem with him is he\u2019s an Arsenal fan, but even Gooners deserve a chance in life\u2026 and marrying into a Chelsea family gives him a chance to see the light before his life is totally ruined.\nPeter will know by now that Karen\u2019s not the shy, retiring type - she likes to be the centre of attention. That\u2019s probably why she took to dancing from an early age \u2013 she joined a dance school at the age of three and I didn\u2019t see her again until she was18, still, it kept her out of trouble.\nShe\u2019s also very strong willed, as Peter will have found out, and we\u2019ve had many a battle of wills over the years. Susan reckons that\u2019s because we\u2019re too much alike, but I think she takes after her mother.\nSeriously though, I know that Karen and Peter will be as happy as Susan and I are, and can look forward to many happy years together.\nKaren is a very caring and loving person. She\u2019s my only daughter, and I love her and I\u2019m very proud to have her as my daughter.\nPlease join me in raising your glasses in a toast to the happy couple \u2013 Karen & Peter.\nI\u2019d now like to hand over to my son-in-law \u2013 Peter.\nWow, what an emotional wedding \u2013 even the cake\u2019s in tiers!\nWedding Speeches - Guidelines for Wedding Speakers\nExample speeches: Father - Groom - Bride - Best man - Quotes & Jokes\nFREE NEWSLETTER\nKeep up with latest news and events in the wedding industry.
