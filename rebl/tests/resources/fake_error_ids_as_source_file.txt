Also links to useful translation tips.\nTranslator or Translation Rates, Charges, Prices and Fees\nThis page was written because many applying translators\nasked us for advice on what is a good translation rate and price to charge. If\nyou are a customer and would like to know our rates as a translation company,\nplease contactus directly, or check out our\ntranslation pricespage.\nSearching for \u201ctranslation\u201d on google will yield\napproximately 140 million results, making the translation industry very\ncompetitive indeed. Almost anyone can put a webpage together, and with roughly\n85% of the world population speaking at least two languages, you\u2019ve got\nsomething to contend with. Once you\u2019ve established a reputation for yourself and\npicked up a few steady customers you can start increasing your prices, but when\nbeginning your translation career it can be difficult to choose a rate to\ncharge. Below you will find various suggestions how to develop a pricing\nstrategy for your translation services.\nIf youare just starting\nout you may consider charging on the lower end, to help you get your foot in the\ndoor. After managing a translation company for 20 years and receiving lots of\ntender applications, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find quality translators in the\nfollowing price ranges:  \nWork\nat Home Translation Jobs\nEnglish/Spanish:\n0.04 - 0.06+ Euro/word\n\nFrench\n0.06+\nGerman\n0.06 - 0.08+\nScandinavian\n0.08 - 0.12+\nCzech, Polish\n0.04 - 0.06\nRussian, Uzbek etc.\n0.03 - 0.05\nHungarian\n0.05 - 0.07\nChinese/Asian\n0.04 - 0.05+\nAfrican\ncan be quite pricey and we do not have enough translators\n(or work) in these languages yet to offer accurate information on this.\nA seasoned translator can generally translate at least\n2,500 words a day, to give you an idea how much you could earn at these rates.\nI also received many offers which were lower, but the\nquality of their translation samples was generally undesirable \u2013 quite possibly\nfrom non-natives living in less expensive countries and who could afford to\ncharge such rates. Then again, some customers only require an \u201cinformative\u201d\ntranslation and the lower rates suit them.\nFor a particular language combinationyou may look at what\nother translators are charging according to how they filled in our translator\napplication form (we have more than 12,000 translators in our database). You are\nwelcome to add your own rate, but your details will not be added to our\ntranslator database. Note that rates charged to direct customers are\ngenerally higher than fees charged to translation companies. The % is a wild\ncard, so chin% would yield both \"chinese mandarin\" and \"chinese traditional\".\nHere are a few links of other websites posting recommended translator charges:\nProZ\nTranslators Cafe\nTranslators Base\nShare|\nHowever, from my experience, these appear to be rates\ncharged by translators who have an existing and well developed client base, or\ntheir \u201chopeful\u201d rates. What one writes on their CV or portfolio may differ from\nwhat they are willing to accept when bidding on an actual project.\nFor example, Translator Caf\u00e9\u2019s posted rates for Czech to\nEnglish translations are as follows:\nshowing an average of 0.08 USD/word charged by translators\nliving in the Czech Republic. On a local level though, I know it is very\ndifficult to get more than 250 Kc per target page, which works out to about 0.06\nUSD per source word. Local companies rarely pay more than this, and often less. I\u2019ve also applied to many tenders on ProZ and experimented with different\nprices, and anything over 0.06 is generally ignored. This is what Proz's statistics show for Czech to English rates:\nWhat is the best part of translating?\nTrend in Translation Prices\nIn short, the story goes as follows (as drawn\nfrom www.commonsenseadvisory.com): \nSo, with the internet opening up markets, increasing competition in some language combinations while increased trade with other countries is increasing demand for their languages, prices have become dynamic indeed.\nPossible Strategies When Deciding on What Translation Prices to Charge\npretend you are a potential customer, approach several\ntranslation companies and ask them what they would charge for a particular\ndocument. Companies will generally charge between 0.01 and 0.06 Euro/USD per\nword, possibly more, in addition to what the translator charges.\nbefore filling out many application forms you might want\nto phone around to a few translation companies and ask them what rate they\ngenerally offer their translators.\nwhen setting your price make a note somewhere that you\ncan be flexible with your fee, depending on the project particulars.\nwhen offering a price to a direct customer, consider what\ncompanies charge and offer something slightly less, but more than what the\ncompanies generally offer their translators.\nwhen bidding on tenders, scatter your prices and\nexperiment. If one customer accepts your higher offer, you are not bound to take\nwork from another offer where you submitted a lower price. With such\nexperimentation you can develop a \u201cfeel\u201d for the market.\nbefore submitting a price on a particular project, make\nsure that you understand the conditions (due date etc.) and take a good look at\nthe text. Try to translate some parts, at least in your head. If it is very\ndifficult for you and will take you longer to translate, you should raise your\nprice accordingly. On the other hand, rather than squeeze yourself out of the\nmarket, you may consider accepting a more competitive rate and use the\nopportunity to practice and research the field. Over time you will be able to\ntranslate faster, and during which you could have built up useful translation\nmemory and glossary terms. At least this way you will secure for yourself a\nsteadier supply of work, you could eventually be considered an expert and start\nraising your prices.\nif the deadline is short for the volume and you will have\nto work hard and long hours to meet the schedule, you should generally charge\nmore. But keep in mind that you are also earning more by translating the higher\nvolume over a shorter period of time, and your competition might be willing to\naccept their standard rate. Again, it is good to be vague with your pricing. You\ncan try a higher price, but if you need the work, you can mention words like\n\u201cflexible\u201d and \u201cI would liketo\ncharge\u201d.\nif you are receiving repeat and regular work from a\nsatisfied customer, you might consider asking them for a price increase. But\nalways be polite, as an offended customer is easily a lost customer, and winning\ncustomers in the first place can be a lengthy and time-consuming process.\nif you are getting more work than you can handle and from\ndifferent sources, this is the perfect time to increase your translation fee to\nnew customers. To convince potential new customers of your high quality\nservices, beef up your CV and website with testimonies from your existing\ncustomers, and translation samples from your more difficult projects.\nFollow-up: What to Do After Submitting Your Translation Price, Rate or Fee\nIf it is an important or large project, it is good to send\nyour offer from at least two sources/email addresses, to make sure your\npotential translation customer receives your application (because of spam\nfilters etc). If you do not hear back from them you can write in a few days to\nfurther express your interest. But keep in mind that such large and potentially\nlucrative projects can receive applications from many translators, and that the\nproject managers could be swamped trying to process them all. But by expressing\nyour keen interest you are revealing your enthusiasm, which is important, as\nwell as your potential to decrease your price, if that is an issue.\nOnce your potential client expresses interest in your\napplication they will often ask you to jump through some hoops, such as to\nprovide a free translation sample, references or other tedious and non-paying\nwork. If you have not done so already now is a good time to check out the\ncompany\u2019s\npayment reputation. If the company has a good reputation. If the company has a good reputation it is quite possible it could lead to\nlots of future work, in which case it is worthwhile to do the necessary prep\nwork. But make sure to do it properly, because any shortcomings could cast a\npoor impression. If you did not fill in their application form correctly, or you\nleft mistakes in your translation sample, they will think you will be lenient\nand that there could be many problems if they did decide to send you some work. For this you might like to read up on our translation project bidding\nsuggestions [..\nTo make yourself look better in the eyes of enquiring\ncustomers, you might also consider obtaining certification from one or more\nsources. Get tested and prove your abilities. If you provided good quality to\nother customers in the past, try to get a reference from them. If you\naccomplished some difficult translations and you are not dishonouring a\nnon-disclosure agreement, consider posting to your online profile some samples\nof your previous work. You are not only competing in price, so make sure you\nlook good to your potential client.\nIt\u2019s a competitive industry, but there\u2019s also a lot of work\nto be had, since the industry generally grows by 20% each year (relating to a\nglobalizing world and increased trade between countries). There are also many\nbenefits of working in the comfort of your home. Therefore, think sharp and good\nluck!\nShare|\nIf you have any suggestions or commentswe\u2019d love to hear\nback from you!\n[Jul 3, 2016] Wow what a through explanation,\nI was waiting for this article as I was very much confused about my translation rates to be asked from a client. Thanks you cleared much. I am an Indian Translator and got an offer from an Indian English writer to translate his best selling book into Hindi. Gave my rates though, what you think would be the rate for\nEnglish to Hindi translation of a 225 page book?\nAccording to the above database query, 94\ntranslators had submitted their rates for English to Hindi, the average working\nout to 0.061/w. But for a book I would usually offer a discount, and depends on\nhow difficult the translation is and the deadline. If you have more time for the\ntranslation, you can take on other work and use the big project as a filler, in\nwhich case you can offer more of a discount. Always turns out a bit of a dance\nand play with the customer when trying to set a final price. Make sure you get\npaid in installments as you make partial deliveries, unless you completely trust\nthe customer.\nKENAX Translation Services- Quality service at a competitive price\n| Contact\nThe previous text for this page (the updated version is above)\nThis could be a difficult subject for a translation agency\nto post, as the translator will always want to receive the most for their hard work, and\nthe translation agency always pay the least, so that it could win the most tenders. Basically it is a bidding war. Any agency, or even individual translator, can post their\nservice on the internet, where files and even payments can be effortlessly transferred as\nif the end client and translator were located in the same city. In fact, we have mediated\nwork where both the translator and the customer were located near to each other, without\neven knowing, while on the other side of the world from us.\nThis becomes the age old problem of determining what a translator or agency can charge or\nget away with. Companies have been battling this question since time immemorial and for\nthis reason corporate spying and espionage exist. It is always a great temptation to learn\nwhat the other translators on a particular tender are charging, and we try to offer this\ninformation to our translators if they ask.\nHistorically, there are several types of bidding processes. The bidding\nmay be open, so that everyone knows what the highest bid is. The bidding may start at some\nbasement price. Other times the bidding is closed, meaning the bidders have to guess, in\nwhich case they might end up paying substantially more than the second highest bidder.\nFor translations, the matter is made further complicated because the bidding is not on the\nsame product, meaning that the quality and speed offered by the individual translators\noften differs.\nSometimes a customer may require only an informative\ntranslation, not requiring great quality, nor even a translation by a native speaker. Hence the bidding \"war\" includes non-native speakers in lower cost countries.\nOther times the customer may demand a very high quality translation, to include a\nproofread by a quality translator, the subject matter can be very technical and require an\nexpert, and the customer may be willing to pay for this quality.\nOther times the customer may require something very quickly and is forced to pay whatever\nit takes to get the job done on time.\nThe way we like to work is to charge a low flat rate on top of whatever\nthe translator charges. With our global system of\ntranslation servicesand our project managers located on different time zones, we have\nmanaged to reduce our overhead to enable us to charge this low surcharge on top of\nwhatever the translator charges. This enables us to win more tenders, whereby we might end\nup using the same translator as any other agency, increase our volume, in turn reducing\nour markup further, to win more tenders and increase our volume further.\nSo no matter how much the translator charges or the customer agrees to pay, our markup\nwill always remain the same (although we may charge more for first time customers to cover\nthe risk of non-payment).\nIt may seem unethical for us to disclose what the other translators are\ncharging, as such opening up the table to a bidding war so to speak, but enough of our\ntranslators have asked for this information in the past, which is why we have decided to\nmake this information public (shown below).\nKeep in mind that these prices are a general guideline of the average charged by quality\ntranslators and do not necessarily represent some ceiling for us or what we hope to pay. Sometimes we get very large projects which need to be accomplished in very short periods,\nand for which we often resort to much more expensive translators, just to get the job done\non time. In these cases we would add up the total charge for the entire project, divide it\nby the number of words translated to calculate a per word price what it cost us, perhaps\noffer some discount to the customer because of the overall size of the project, and then\nround the figure to some nice sounding price, issuing an invoice to the customer based on\nthat.\nMost of our customers trust us and accept our strategy, and most of the time our estimate\nat the beginning of a project is very accurate. Other times the customer may demand a\nconcrete price in writing, in which case we would be forced to guess on the higher end, to\nprotect ourselves against the unforeseeable. This is just the usual issues of running any\nbusiness.\nFor each project we always ask the translator what they\nwould like to charge, and move forward from there. Perhaps a lot needs to be done over a\nholiday, or the subject matter is very technical. We never force our translator to agree\non a permanently defined price and they are always entitled to change their price at any\nmoment. Based on a preliminary response from our translators, we can then issue a price\nestimate to the customer, and if we win the tender based on that, then we can proceed from\nthere.\nFrom the perspective of the translator, perhaps they might be free at the moment and be\nglad to work full time on a project for a month, offering us a discount, which we could\nthen pass onto the client to help us all win the tender.\nOther times the translator can be busy with other work, charge something\nmore because of the headache of having to go into overtime, and we might accept the higher\nprice because the situation demands it and the customer's budget can afford it.\nOr other times the translator may have developed a good name for themselves, with steady\nclients sending them subject matters they are comfortable with. Such a translator is in an\nexcellent position, and can afford to charge a higher price to new clients. Heck, such a\ntranslator can even begin to farm out projects to other quality translators, control their\nwork, charge their own markup rate, increase their volume, and eventually begin to operate\nlike an agency. This is the wonderful power afforded by the internet. I myself translated\nfor 8 years and during which time I slowly migrated to operating only an agency. In fact,\nI still translate from time to time, although I much more enjoy project management and\ncompany development.\nMy suggestion is to always seek new customers when you do not have paying\nwork. If you want to develop an agency while most of your earnings comes from your own\ntranslation work, you can work on that on your own free time. When looking for new\ncustomers, you can spend your time approaching a list of translation agencieslike ours (or for a small fee have us do this\nfor you), or filling in their translator applicationforms, or provide them with free translation\nsamples. All this takes an investment of time. In the beginning you might offer a more\nattractive rate just to secure yourself with enough work, but over time, as you build up a\nreputation for yourself and steady clients with a steady stream of work, you can start to\ncharge more to new clients, or approach your existing customers and ask if they might\noffer you more, considering how reliable you have been for them all these years.\nYou might consider a premium rate for express work or on translations which need to be\naccomplished over the weekend or holidays. You may devise different rates for different\nsubjects or volumes. Everything is possible, and every business does this. Just think\nabout the airline industry, which charges premium rates for the business class who need a\nflight on short notice, while offering much cheaper rates for tickets bought well in\nadvance, or even lower rates for student or standby tickets. Which are tickets sold only\nwhen some seats remain available and just before takeoff. In economics and business\nlanguage this is called price discrimination, which in some ways can be considered illegal\nor unethical, but practiced nevertheless. For this purpose very complicated software\nprograms have been developed for the airline industry, estimating which seasons will be\nbusier, and formulating a complex price grid, all designed to maximize profits for the\nairline company by charging different prices to different people.\nSo you can certainly try your own price discrimination, although I do not think there is\nany software developed like this for the translation industry. You might approach a few\ntranslation agencies (by pretending you are a potential customer) and see what they charge\nfor your language combination and expertise, in turn charging them an appropriate price.\nWhen charging a direct customer as opposed to a\ntranslation agency, you might try charging something in between what an agency charges and\nwhat you would normally charge an agency. If you establish a good name with direct\nclients, there is no reason why you couldn't charge as much or more than the agency if you\nare really good or are knowledged in a special area, which your customer needs.\nWhen submitting your price to a new client, you can also be vague and try\nsomething on the higher end. You can say \"Some of my existing customers pay me\",\nor \"If possible\", and include \"price negotiable\", for example. You\nobviously want as much as possible, but you do not want to scare away your new potential\nclient either, so if you are quoting high, do not make it seem like your price is firm and\nset in stone - unless of course you are so well established you do not need to look for\nother customers. In such a case you are ideally established, and you might consider\nscreening your own translators and quality control their work, so that you can offer a\nhigher capacity.\nPrices often vary among language combinations precisely because of the\ncosts of living in those countries.\nTypically, translations in Scandinavian languages will cost a lot more than, for example,\nHindu or Russian translations. This has nothing to do with the quality of the respective\ntranslators but everything to do with the costs of living of the countries where these\nlanguages are mostly spoken. Of course, it may happen that a Swedish translator has\ndecided to move to Beijing China, has chosen to charge three times the local Beijing rate\nfor his translations from German and English into Swedish, is quite well off at those\nrates considering the cost of living in China, while offering a rate which is less than\nhalf what the average Swedish translator is forced to charge because they live in\nStockholm. So such a China based Swedish translator can benefit from lots of work and live\nquite well. This again is the strength (or for some, the annoyance) that the internet\noffers, but such is the fact of life in this increasingly global marketplace.\nThis is why you should consider the prices we have posted below as a very\nrough guideline. They are based on the prices of quality translators we have found. This\nis not to say that we have not found less expensive translators, like the quality Swedish\ntranslator living in China, but we have chosen not to post these \"extremes\" but\nrather just the average. There are also many translators who charge more than this, but at\nthe below prices we have not found it difficult to find quality translators.\nPossible Guideline to Help You Set your Prices\nAfter a debate on ProZ, I modified the below data and aspire to achieve some \"wiki consensus\".\nI will break up the prices according to the following. For those who are only just considering to start a career in translations, an average seasoned translator can translate between 2500 and 5000 words a day.\n1) Your Local Rates\nAsk your local translation agencies what they offer.\n2) According to Projects I have Managed in the Past (table above)\nThese generally reflect the lowest price levels offered by my quality native translators. It should also reflect the local prices for those countries, quite possibly on the higher end. It could be a good price suggestion for someone who would like to work on the global web translation market.\n3) ProZ's and Translator Caf\u00e9's Posted Rates\nProZ's rate data is only available for full paid members, but TC's is open to free members. Taking Czech to English translationsas an example (because I have many years and active experience in this language combination), TC's rates show the following:\nFrom my experience these definitely do not reflect local prices in the Czech Republic (TC's are significantly higher), so perhaps consider these as aspired prices. Or what would apply if you live in Western Europe. The translation market is a very competitive place so it's good to do some research and see what options are best for you. Or combine approaches and see where that leads to.\n4) According to Applicants in our Database\nThis tableis drawn from our own database of applicants, while removing the extremes (above 30 and below 1 cent a word). It is raw data only and the quality of the translators has not been verified. We get about 4 applicants a day, from all over the world.\nYou may add your own rate and I will continue to develop this as interest in it increases. The averages script timed out before it could make the complex calculations, so unfortunately it did not include all the language combinations (stopped at Portuguese to Turkish). I will try to resolve this later to include all the language combinations.\nOther Websites to Help you Choose your Translation Rates\nProZ\nTranslators Cafe\nTranslators Base\nShare|\nImportant Translator or Translation Rates, Charges, Prices and Fee Links\nTranslation Payments Reputation- before you\ntake on a translation project from a new client you should check out what other\ntranslators have said about their payment practices and if they are a reliable payer.\nGetting\nPaid for Translation Work- once you have translated for them but are finding\ndifficulties getting paid, read what a couple of international lawyers have said about\nextracting payment.\nTranslation\nTips- to help you do a good job translating, which will bring you repeated\ntranslation work and increase your chances of getting paid.\nTranslation Resources- links to various translator resources to help\nyou with your work.\nTranslation\nJobs- many forums and resources to help you find translation work.\nTranslation\nAgencies- or approach the agencies directly by email without hunting down their\naddresses on the net.\nTranslator Application- come join our growing team!", "docid": "msmarco_doc_00_89242"}

Postmedia may earn an affiliate commission from purchases made through links on this page.\nArticle content\nQuestion: When grilling, do I leave the lid open or closed?\nAnswer: This depends on what you\u2019re cooking, the size/type of your barbecue and the weather outside.\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\nTry refreshing your browser, or\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\nWhen grilling, do I leave the lid open or closed? Back to video\nIn a professional restaurant kitchen setting, where taste matters more than energy efficiency, chefs typically cook steaks on a grill that has no lid. They use them to grill chicken, sausages, salmon and pretty much anything else that requires even heat for a relatively short time. These grills are much more powerful than a home barbecue, allowing them to reach high heat without requiring an enclosed space.\nIn a home setting, where you\u2019re as concerned about the energy bill as the taste of your meal, cooking with an open lid can seem needlessly wasteful. An open lid means lost heat, which means more gas is required to maintain the temperature of the grill. The energy incentive of closed-lid cooking seems obvious, in the same way you keep an oven door closed when baking a cake and the door of the house closed during the middle of an Alberta winter.\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nBut in practice, it\u2019s not that simple.\nThere are reasons to cook with the lid open, at least in certain circumstances. Trapping heat inside your barbecue makes it cook more like an oven than a grill; that\u2019s fine if you want to use your barbecue as an oven to bake a pie or roast a chicken, but it\u2019s not ideal if you want to use it for many of the things an oven can\u2019t do.\nWith the lid open, you get precise control over the heat hitting one surface of your food; with the lid closed, you still have the heat acting on the bottom of the food, but it also picks up heat from the air surrounding it, which can lead to mixed results. For example, closing the lid means you can\u2019t get the same quality sear on both sides of a steak, as the top will already be partially cooked by the time the steak is flipped.\nAfter a chat with our chef instructors and home economists, we\u2019ve compiled a list of cooking scenarios where either a closed lid or an open lid on the barbecue would be ideal:\nClosed Lid:\n\u2013 Pizza on a baking stone\n\u2013 Anything baked (pies, crumbles, etc.)\n\u2013 Preheating the grill\n\u2013 Indirect cooking\n\u2013 Cooking a whole chicken\n\u2013 Smoking something with a smoke box\n\u2013 Grilling large pieces of meat like a turkey, roast, leg of lamb, etc.\n\u2013 Anything that falls under the proverbial \u201clow-and-slow\u201d grilling technique\n\u2013 Food cooked on a rotisserie\nOpen Lid:\n\u2013 Burgers\n\u2013 Steaks\n\u2013 Hot dogs\n\u2013 Shrimp, prawns, zucchini planks and other small things that could easily be ruined by overcooking\n\u2013 Kebabs\nAdvertisement\nStory continues below\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\nArticle content\nKeep in mind the heat/intensity of your grill, along with adverse weather conditions, may make cooking on an open grill difficult. Your barbecue must be able to generate enough consistent heat to cook food thoroughly one side at a time. If you\u2019re struggling with this, know that a clean barbecue makes better use of its heating power.\nMake sure you check the internal temperature of anything you grill; if using your grill with the lid open means you can\u2019t easily reach the correct internal temperature, cook items with the lid closed instead.\n\u2014\nWe Can Help! is a weekly column from ATCO Blue Flame Kitchen.

But since it\u2019s summer and the best time to travel, we needed some new motorcycle trips. The U.S. south is too hot this time of year, so we\u2019re headed to the Pacific Northwest.\nHighway 20 Washington Pass, Washington\nThe Washington 20\nWashington state has arguably the most breathtaking mountain scenery in the United States. Highway 20 is no different. This 65 mile ride starts in Marblemount and ends in Winthrop.\nThe route takes you through North Cascade National Park, and you\u2019ll climb up to 8000 feet in elevation. The lookouts feature mountains, old growth forests, and many waterfalls. This is a trip for experienced riders: the roads are twisty with rockfall warnings.\nThe Devil\u2019s Tail, Oregon\nThe Devil\u2019s Tail in Hells Canyon\nThe Devil\u2019s Tail in Hells Canyon is one of the most famous motorcycle roads in the world. Hells Canyon is 2000 feet deeper than the Grand Canyon. The Hells Canyon Scenic Byway starts in Baker City, but the 22 mile Devil\u2019s Tail is the best part of the ride.\nThere are hundreds of twists and turns. Watch for rock falls and tar snakes. The scenery is jaw-dropping. The canyon forms the base of the Seven Devils Mountains, and you\u2019ll cross Snake River into Idaho.\nThe Klickitat Loop, Washington\nKlickitat Loop\nAnother great Washington ride is the 80 mile Klickitat Loop. Starting in Bingen, you\u2019ll head west, then ride?north and loop around to Klickitat. The best part of this ride is the lack of traffic, cops, and tourists.\nThe scenery is great, and the roads are fun. There are small lakes and mountains along the ride. Be sure to stop at the replica of Stonehenge. The roads feature?wide sweeps and nice curves.\nMount Rainier, Washington\nMount Rainier\nAnother national park in the Cascades features the dormant volcano Mount Rainier. Start your ride in Elbe and head east to Sunset Park road in the national park. This road is by far the most scenic in the park.\nYour scenery will take you through lakes and rivers, mountains and canyons, waterfalls and dropoffs. The roads are well maintained and feature many sharp turns and zig-zags. You\u2019ll climb high, as Mount Rainier sits at 14,411 feet above sea level.\nAufderheide Memorial Drive, Oregon\nAufderheide Memorial Drive\nThis 60 mile ride takes you from Oakridge, through the Willamette National Forest, and north to Rainbow, Oregon. The views are stunning, and the roads are well-kept.\nThe forests are filled with?old Douglas Firs. The rivers are brilliant blue, and the lookout at Cougar Dam is worth stopping. There\u2019s camping available, too, just make sure you\u2019re not there in the winter.\nDisqus Recommendations\nWe were unable to load Disqus Recommendations.
