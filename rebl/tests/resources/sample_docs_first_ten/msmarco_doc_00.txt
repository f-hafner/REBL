Those are all important, but the most asked question is, \u201cWhat\u2019s the 0-60 time?\u201d This is nothing more than a measure of how quickly a vehicle can reach the 60 mile per hour mark. It is a measure of acceleration of a vehicle. 0-60 times differ a great deal depending on the amount of power a motor puts out, of course. But anyone who spends any amount of time with car enthusiasts are sure to hear the ubiquitous term bantered around more often than most other metrics by which cars are measured in terms of power.\nThe only other measure that comes close as far as how acceleration is commonly measures in cars in the United States is the quarter mile time. Enthusiasts will often ask about how quickly a car can get through a quarter mile, but that can be seen as less accurate a estimate of acceleration than the amount of time it takes a vehicle to reach the sixty miler per hour mark. The quarter mile time can often have more variable such as driver experience.\nThe 0-60 mph speed is used as the standard in the United States, where the rest of the world prefers the 0-100 km version. But both measure the performance of a car. A lot goes into increasing 0-60 times in performance vehicles. As a normal rule of thumb, performance cars are considered those with 0-60 time of under 6 seconds, while Exotic cars will do 0-60 in 3 to 4 seconds. However, in most cases, a car isn\u2019t simply \u201cstuck with\u201d the acceleration number with which it was born. Engineers and designers work tirelessly to provide better and better numbers with each progressive model of performance and exotic cars. But, even the back yard mechanic or muscle car enthusiast can determine the 0-60 times of their cars and make moves to improve them.\nThe testing of acceleration is usually done on a closed course away from people other than the team that may be working on the specific car. This limits putting anyone in danger who is not part of the test or the ongoing project. Testers can use something as simple as a stop watch and the vehicle\u2019s speedometer. This is probably good enough for the typical muscle car enthusiast who is just looking for an estimate of how much power his latest improvements will give him. For engineers testing a new exotic sports car, though, a simple estimate is not accurate enough. They want hard and fast 0-60 times, and they use much more highly-technical equipment to get their numbers. With the 0-60 figure being so important in automobile sales, they do everything possible to ensure their numbers are incredibly accurate.\nIn professional testing situations, highly technical and accurate measuring devices are hooked to computers as the test is performed. The test is run in two different directions, to eliminate any influence of wind, an unseen downhill grade or any differences in traction. The average of these two times will be the recorded 0-60 time for the car. Doppler radar guns are used to ensure the tester is recording exact 0 -60 times. This leaves the driver to focus solely on running through the gears as precisely as possible and simply driving in a straight line. This allow for a more accurate measure, as does running the test first in one direction and then in the exact opposite direction.\nSome still feel, however, that listing one 0 \u2013 60 time is not truly indicative of what a new owner can expect from a performance or exotic car, or even a muscle car. Instead, some believe the measure should include a range of times rather than one finite mark to which all cars of any particular model should be held. For instance, they believe a BMW M3 should have a listed time of 3.9 \u2013 4.2 seconds and a Corvette Z06 should have a range from 3.6 to 4.0. These people believe that a range of numbers better represents what an owner can honestly expect to see when he or she takes delivery of a new vehicle.\nThis contingent of car enthusiasts and engineers believes that there is no way for either the time to 60 mph or even a quarter mile time to be completely accurate, as there are simply too many variables that come into play. No matter if you are a 0 \u2013 60 purist, or you believe that it is an inexact science, you can be sure that the measure itself will not be going away any time soon. It is still one of the biggest touted numbers for vehicles, and easier for people to relate to than horsepower and torque.", "docid": "msmarco_doc_00_0"}

To explain this, let us go\nto the beginning of what we can define as time. Let us presume that, before the big bang, there was only\nenergy, and no time. We can say that God was this energy. And \"then\" he decided\nto make things, so he converted this energy into massand hence was created the big bang, which was an explosion of the energy force turning\ninto matter. Exploding outwards in all directions, and creating the universe, or many\nuniverses, and therefore dimensions, where time is considered the fourth dimension.\nEverything is relative. A plant grows. We compare the states \"after\" and\n\"before\", and in our minds we think time. An object moves from point A to point\nB, or relative to what we call points A and B, the universe shifts around, we call it\nbefore and after, and label the \"time\" it took for that object to move between\nthese two points.\nFor us on earth, our reference point for time is the sun, the most obvious object in\nour sphere of perception, with its movement \"around us\". But in fact it is not\nmoving around us, but our earth is spinning. When the created particles exploded outward\nfollowing the big bang, because they were little particles of mass, they were attracted to\neach other, because mass objects are attracted to each other by gravity. We can stand on\nthe earth because we are a mass object attracted to the great (relative to us) mass object\nof the earth. A Chinese person is upside down compared to a US person, because they are on\nthe other side of the planet attracted and drawn by gravity to\nits centre.\nIn the same manner, all the\nlittle mass particles jetting outwards from the centre of the big bang explosion are\nattracted to one anotherby gravity. Some particles are closer\nto one another, and they start to form clusters and groups. The clusters and groups which\nare attracted towards each other do so like water going down a drain. The\nfastest and naturally most efficient way for the water to go down a drain is to start\nspinning, which also creates a hole in the centre through which air can escape upwards, as\nthe space the air previously consumed is now being replaced by the descending water. Water\ngoing down a drain in the southern hemisphere of our planet spins in the opposite directionas water going down the drain in the northern hemisphere.\nIn the same way when these mass particles start to\nattract to one another during our forming universe, they\nnaturally form a spinning disk, much like with\nthe water going down the drain. This big disk could\neventually form a galaxy, universe, or solar system, with the most clusters and mass in\nthe centre of the disk, all of it spinning around.\nOn a solar system level (solar means a sun), the most mass in the centre can form a\nsun, like ours. There is so much mass that the sheer weight of all these mass particles,\nattracted to one another under gravity, becomes so great that the pressure eventually\nignites and starts a chemical reaction. Under the sheer weight of it all, and pressure,\nthe chemical reaction converts hydrogen and helium back into energy, which we see as\nlight and feel as heat.\nThe mass of our earth is also a lot, and the weight and pressure of this mass is great enough that, if we were to bore a hole 3 km towards the centre of the earth, the pressure\nand heat would be strongenough to meltall our equipment (which are basically made from the iron ore found in our\nearth's, cooled crust). We are actually sitting on a very thin crust, the outer\nlayer of the earth, which has cooled downto the point that we\ncan stand on it(although, in the earlier days of the earth's\ndevelopment, the crust was mostly molten lava and exploding volcanoes, and it took a long\ntime to cool down to where it is now). Past 3 km from the surface it is still all molten lava, which occasionally escapes to the surface\nthrough volcanoes or largeearthquakes. But our earth is not\nlarge enough to ignite the reaction which createsenergy (which is conversion of mass back into energy) to turn it\ninto a star. But Jupiterhas just enough mass to make it a small star. There are other stars in the universe which\nare such a large collection of mass and produce so much gravity that they do not even let\nlight escape, sucking everything into it.\nFor the same reason that the particles of mass travelling outwards from the initial big bang have drawn together in spinning disks, the hazy mass within the\nforming and spinning solar systems have also conglomerated into spinning matter,\neventually forming spinning planets, now revolving around the sun at the same speed as the\nforming solar disk was previously spinning. There are two interesting theories regarding\nthe relative distance of the planets from the sun. One was postulated by Galileo < who\ndrew geometric shapes with an increasing number of sides, and found that they perfectly\nfit into one another <link and add picture> . Another theory < calculates that\nthe relative distances of the planets from the sun correlate exactly with the relative\ndistance between the frequencies of musical notes, whereby F# would be the asteroid belt,\nand hence deemed an unstable orbit and where a planet could not form properly. This is\njust one example of the amazing harmony of nature, which one can also consider as proof of\nthe divine existence of God.\nTherefore, we have our sun in the centre of our own solar system, and our planet spins in an orbit around it, our planet itself spinning around, with the\nmoon spinning in an orbit around us.\nPrague's\nOrloj Clock- an\ninteresting history\nAs our planet spins, it appears to us that the sun revolves around us. The Sumerians(the\nrace of people living in Mesopotamia in what is now modern day\nIraq and from where Abraham first came and was called by God)were the first great civilisation on earth and which defined for us time, using another\nvery common object for us: our hands and fingers. If we were a Sumerian, how might we divide up a day, which is\nbasically the time it takes for our earth to spin around once, or from our perspective,\nfor our sun to revolve around us until it came\nback to the same place it started at? Well, we might look\nat our hands and fingers and use them to divide up things. We\nwould divide up the entire day into two: the dark half and the light half. We have four\nfingers and a thumb. Looking at the four fingers, each has three segments, making up 12 segments total. Three segments times four fingers makes\n12, so let us divide up each half day into 12 hours. Now if we take this number 12\ngenerated by the four fingers of our left hand, and multiply it by the fingers and thumb\nof our right hand, we get 12 hours times 5, which makes 60. So lets divide each hour into\n60 individual minutes, and divide up each minute into 60 individual seconds. And this is\nprecisely how we humans have defined for ourselves time. A year, which works out to 365\ndays (with some leap years, because our means of creating time is not exact), is the\nnumber of times the earth spins around its own axis (creating what we call a day) while\nthe earth revolves in its orbit around the sun to come back to the same place it started\nat.\nThis is how the Sumerians defined\ntime. But because the world is a round globe, the beginning of night and day is different\ndepending on where you are located in the world. What is high noon for someone in the US\nwould be pitch black midnight for someone in China, on the other side of the world. Therefore, over time, we humans started to draw imaginary lines on the planet, cutting up\nthe planet into 24 parts, one for each hour of the day.\nIn the days of old, people used a sundial to tell the time, which is basically a solar\nclock. A little stick at a certain angle which would cast a shadow as the sun, from our\nperspective, would revolve around our planet. But as humans advanced, and with the\ninvention of railroads (the first time zone GMT was in fact created by British Railways),\nand transportation becoming faster and faster, it got to a point where it was necessary to\nset some relative times between each place. So the earth was carved into one hour slices,\nusually along political borders, or what we humans thought would be the best way. This way, if ever taking a train, you would know exactly what time you\nshould arrive at a certain city, which fell in a certain time zone, subtract or add the\nnumber of hours on your clock, and everything started to make better sense for our\ndeveloping societies.\nDuring humanity\u2019s development, the period during all this defining was when England\nwas a great power in the world, controlling many colonies. And with such power during this\ndevelopment, and such a strong naval power, in 1675 they labelled the centre of our time\nin Greenwich, and defined Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) as the zero time zone to help ships\nnavigate the world and define longitudinal lines, such that the remaining parts of the\nworld were either plus or minus so many hours from this zeropoint. The sun rises from our west and sets in our east. So if we move along the planet\nwestwards, we are going back in our little created time, towards the morning of the time\nzone we are moving towards. Likewise, if we fly east, we are flying towards the setting\nsun, towards the end of the day, and hence we would add time to our clock. But in the big\nscheme of things, the time in the universe is steady, whereby we\nare only adding or subtracting hours on our own clock, simply\nfor the convenience of defining for us what is morning and what is evening(in terms of the angle of the sun with reference to the point on the globe\nthat we are stationed at). And if we go far enough west or east, meaning 12 hours\nin either direction from the GMT zero time, we will end up on the other side of the world\nfrom Greenwich England, where we could add or subtract half a day. So on one side of this\nother imaginary line it is a day later or earlier than on the other side. But this is just\nhow we have divided up things, based on our fingers and the rotation of the earth and sun.\nIn the big scheme of things, time is constant, and God is\neternal. God, in whose eyes \"a day is like a thousand years\", and\nwho is \"the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end\". Things\ncontinue as they continue, and are as they are, but we humans, for our own convenience,\nhave divided up everything according to the number of segments on our fingers. And we wake\nup hurriedly every morning to catch the 6:50 bus, to get to work by 9:00. These are all\nour own inventions.\nAnd then we have daylight savings, which is the adding or\nsubtracting of an hour to or from a particular time zone and at\na particular time of the year, to help the farmer get up early to begin work in his field. But over time, the farmer did not have such an importor dominant role in society. Some areas use daylight savings while\nothers do not. Recently, the US has shifted the time when it applies daylight savings\nbecause it has calculated it can save its economy billions of dollars by not forcing\npeople to use their airconditioners so much at work .\nSo whatever time zone you are located in on this planet, and you are working on a\ntranslation assignment for KENAX, let\nus just agree on a delivery time based on the GMT time zone.

If you are in New York, so EST-5 (5 hours\nearlier than London, as the sun travels\nwestward), you should get to London10 hours\nlater than when you left, so 16:15 (assuming you were leaving in the\nmorning), which would be 4:15pm in London(you are flying eastwards, AGAINST the sun). Hope I figured this out right\nand will try to make some script to compute this for people.\nthe way you mix\nspirituality and science is incredible :)\nThanks, but many scientists believe in God and\nscientists have done some rudimentary scientific research on psychic powers,\nfor example. Science does not automatically mean a lack of spirituality and\nmany things are connected that we do not understand yet. Think of the\nunified theory of relativity.

Spoken in South Africa.\nAfrikaans, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sesotho (the Sesotho name for Southern Sotho), Setswana (the Setswana name for Tswana), Swazi (also known as Siswati), Tsonga (also known as Xitsonga), Venda (also isiVenda), Xhosa (also isiXhosa) and Zulu (also isiZulu) are 10 of the official languages of South Africa (the last and eleventh being English). All these languages are therefore predominantly spoken in South Africa.\n\nAkkadian\nAkkadian is one of the great cultural languages of world history. Akkadian (or Babylonian-Assyrian) is the collective name for the spoken languages of the culture in the three millennia BCE in Mesopotamia, the area between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris, approx. covering modern Irak. The name Akkadian --so called in ancient time-- is derived from the city-state of Akkad, founded in the middle of the third millennium BCE and capital of one of the first great empires after the dawn of human history.\n\nAmharic\nThe National Language of Ethiopia.\n\nArabic\nArabic is spoken by almost 200 million people in more than twenty two countries, from Morrocco to Iraq, and as far south as Somalia and the Sudan. As the language of Quran, the Holy book of Islam, it is thought as a first language in Muslim states throughout the world. Arabic language originated in Saudi Arabia in pre-Islamic times, and spread rapidly across the Middle East.\n\nBambara\nThe language of Bambara or Bamana is spoken in Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso. This language are also used as \"lingua franca\" in West Africa.\n\nBerber\nGroup of languages, from Morocco to Egypt. Differences between the languages can be considerable, due to geographical distances. There are about 300 local dialects. The largest of the Berber languages is found in Kabylia in Algeria. Berber languages form a branch of the Afro-Asiatic linguistic family.\n\nCoptic\nThe Coptic Language is the name used to refer to the last stage of the written Egyptian language. Coptic should more correctly be used to refer to the script rather than the language itself. Even though this script was introduced as far back as the 2nd century BC., it is usually applied to the writing of the Egyptian language from the first century AD. to the present day.\nCoptic was used from its Christian beginnings in the late second century AD. till the time of the Great persecution of Diocletian in the early 4th century AD. predominantly as a translational tool from Greek to Egyptian. After the persecution, the monastic movement picked up tremendous steam. It was for the Copts the only way they can express their great love for God, that they earlier expressed with the willing sacrifice of their most precious possession, their earthly lives. These monastic communities were large and mostly Egyptian. This generated the need for the abbots of these communities to write their rules in their own language, i.e. Coptic. Also the Fathers of the Coptic Church, who usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Coptic.\n\nDamara/Nama\nDamara/Nama, a clicking language, is spoken in Namibia.\n\nEgyptian\nThe language spoken in Egypt. The New Egyptian language is also known as the \"Demotic\" language since it is the colloquial Egyptian spoken by the people. The gradual replacement of Hieroglyphic by Demotic is similar to the replacement of Latin by English French, Italian, etc. Coptic is the common colloquial Egyptian. Its roots stem from from the New Egyptian Language and has a large similitude with the version of the the Egyptian Language of the 25th Kingdom (Saees Kingdom named after its Capital: Sa-ElHahgar).\n\nFula\nFULA (FULBF, FELLATAIT or PEuL5), a numerous and powerful African people, spread over an immense region from Senegal nearly to Darfur. Strictly they have no country of their own, and nowhere form the whole of the population, though nearly always the dominant native race. They are most numerous in Upper Senegal and in the countries under French sway immediately south of Senegambia, notably Futa Jallon. Farther east they rule, subject to the control of the French, Segu and Massena, countries on both banks of the upper Niger, to the south-west of Timhuktu. The districts within the great bend of the Niger have a large Fula population.\n\nGujarati\nGujarati is one of the widely spoken languages of India. It is mainly spoken in the western state of Gujarat in India. Gujarati speaking people have immigrated to many countries worldwide. Some of them are: US, UK, Kenya, South Africa, Fiji New Zealand etc.\n\nHausa\nHausa is spoken in Nigeria and Niger. This language are also used as \"lingua franca\" in West Africa.\n\nIraqi\nThe language spoken in Iraq.\n\nLebanese\nThe language spoken in Lebanon. Levantine Arabic is a general designation used for a continuum of dialects spoken in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Israel. Another name for the cluster is Northwest Arabian Colloquial Arabic. There are 7 million speakers in Syria, almost 4 million in Lebanon, 3 million in Jordan, and 1 million in Israel and Palestine.\n\nLingala\nLingala = Center and north. Primarily in Zadre. Niger-Congo, Atlantic-Congo, Volta-Congo, Benue-Congo, Bantoid, Southern, Narrow Bantu, Northwest, C, Bangi-Ntomba. Lingala belongs to the Ngala Group of Bantu (Guthrie C36) and is spoken along the Lomami, the Ubangi, and the Zaire rivers as far as Kinshasa in Zaire, as well as up the Sangha River through Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic. UBS (1982) notes an exaggerated figure of 8.4 million speakers, the same figure that Grimes (1996) cites as including second language speakers. World Almanac (1998) estimates 8 million total speakers. Heine (1970), citing Roberts (1962), gives 1.2 million.\n\nLuganda\nThe language of Uganda. Luganda, the native language of the people of Buganda, developed over the centuries as a spoken language. Its written form is only as recent as the arrival of the Arab and European influence among the Baganda. It is not easy, and of course it is not within the scope of this discussion, to trace its origins, but it is proper to assume that in a dynamic society with such well structured cultural, social, and political institutions like those of the Baganda, the language must have experienced a reciprocal influence during most of the changes the society went through over the course of its history. It was not however, until after the second half of the nineteenth century, that Luganda was first written down and appeared in print in its own right.\n\nMalagasy\nThe language of Madagascar. More than anything else, the people of Madagascar love oratory. The colorful language, Malagasy, like the people who use it, is a living synthesis of Indonesian, African, and Arabic elements. No conversation is complete without a liberal sprinkling of clever euphemisms and timeworn proverbs. The British missionaries attempted to codify this lyrical language, using the letters of the English alphabet. The Malagasy alphabet is therefore quite similar to the English alphabet, with the following exceptions: The Malagasy alphabet is missing the letters C, Q, U, W, and X. The letter A is always short (as in watch). The letter E sounds like a long A (as in pace). The letter i is pronounced like a long E (as in bean). The letter J sounds like dz. Finally, the letter O sounds like oo.\n\nMandinka\nA language of Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal and spoken widely throughout Western Africa.\n\nMoroccan\nThe language of Morocco. One of the first things one notices about Morocco is its linguistic diversity. French, Berber, Modern Standard Arabic, as well as Moroccan Arabic, can all be heard in all the major cities. This is due primarily to the rich historical past of the country. The Berbers, the original inhabitants, make up roughly half of the population, and the three major dialects of their language are widely spoken. When the Arabs came to Morocco in the 8th century they brought their language, which has evolved into the Moroccan Arabic of today. France officially entered the picture in 1912 when it began the Moroccan protectorate and French is still widely used in commerce and the educational system.\nWhen one speaks of Arabic in Morocco there are two languages to be considered. On the one hand there is Modern Standard Arabic. This is the direct descendant of the language of the Koran and is understood throughout the contemporary Arab world. In Morocco it is used in newspapers, correspondence, news broadcasts and speeches but rarely in conversation. Moroccan Arabic, on the other hand, is the first language of the majority of Moroccans and really the most useful language to know when traveling in the country. It differs from Modern Standard Arabic to the extent that non-Moroccan speakers of Arabic, with the possible exception of Algerians and Tunisians, find it difficult to understand.\n\nMuganda\nBuganda is located in the south-central region of the country known today as Uganda, as shown in the map below. This is right in the heart of Africa, astride the equator, and at the source of the great river Nile. The people of Buganda are referred to as Baganda (the singular form is Muganda), their language is referred to as Luganda, and they refer to their customs as Kiganda customs. Sometimes the generic term Ganda is used for all the above (especially by foreign scholars).\n\nNdebele\nThe term Ndebele refers to a relatively broad range of ethnic groups dispersed across Zimbabwe and the Transvaal province of South Africa. Although they are not kindred in origin, language, or culture, all of these groups are undoubtedly descendants of a proto-Nguni tribe, as are the Xhosa and Zulu, and were resident in what is now KwaZulu and Natal as long as four centuries ago.\n\nNepali\nThe language of Nepal. In structure, Nepali is considered to lie in the middle between Hindi and the East Indic Bengali language. As well as in the East Indic tongues, its vowels have lost a distinction in length. Consonants of Nepali include four series of stops (principal, aspirated, retroflex, retroflex aspirated), a number of sibilants and affricates.\nNepali has totally lost the gender category; its numerous analytical forms, especially those of the verb, are now in process of forming the agglutinative declension system. The Indic ergative construction is not so active as in other languages of the group.\n\nNigerian\nSeveral languages are spoken in Nigeria\nDegema\nEdo\nEfik\nEnglish\nEsan\nHausa\nIbibio\nIdoma\nIgala\nIgbo\nIkwere\nIsekiri\nIsoko\nKalabari\nNupe\nOkobo\nOron\nPidgin\nTiv\nUrhobo\nYoruba\n\nNuer\nThe Nuer is one of the best known of all ethnographic studies, and the reason for this is clear: Evans-Pritchard gives a brilliant and insightful picture of an interesting and unusual people. The Nuer were a pastoral people living along the upper Nile, who had no laws or leaders and were strongly individualistic, with social order maintained by community values and a segmentary tribal and lineage system.\nNumbering approximately one million, the Nuer are the second largest people group (second to the Dinka) in south Sudan. Traditionally, they are cattle herders whose complete way of life revolves around their livestock. Cattle are used for payment of fines and debts and as bride prices in marriage. Children mold clay figures of cows out of clay, ash, wood or any other available material. Young boys have a favorite ox who they give a name and treat as if it was a puppy.\n\nOromo\nThe Oromo language is the third largest language of Africa in the number of native speakers. Afaan Oromo is spoken by over 30 million people in Ethiopa. Afaan Oromo is a language of very beautiful poetry, proverbs of wisdom, and justice. Even though the Oromos are spread over large areas and were prevented from using their language in education, mass media, and public services, the language is still a relatively uniform language with which Oromos from all parts of Ethiopia, and outside Ethiopia, can communicate with relative ease. Colonial Ethiopian governments from Menelik II down to Haile Sellasie, and to some extent the Derg forbade the study, development, and use of the Oromo language in education, public services, and other events including religious teachings, and scholarly studies.\n\nPersian\nAs the second language of the Muslim world and the main language of the Iranian cultural and civililzation literary, mystical, countless precious works in different literary, mystical, philosophical, theological, historical, artistic, and religious areas, Persian has always caught the attention of Iranians and other people in different countries of the world.\n\nPidgin English\nPidgin English = dialect spoken in Occidental Cameroon.\nA Pidgin (and also a Creole) is a language variety used for interethnic contact. In many cases where peoples of different linguistic groups come need to communicate, they use a third language (or material of a third language), in which they have some competence. As a result thereof, the language in question may undergo drastic changes and result in an entirely new language.\n\nSaudi\nThe language which people speak in the Arab world is far more different than Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is the language of the media. It is used on TV and newspapers, but it is not used anywhere else. Saudi Arabic, is the colloquial form of MSA. There aren't much change in the meaning, but the pronunciation differ from that of any other colloquial Arabic, though the saudi Arabic could be classified under (Gulf Arabic). e.g. in MSA, \"How are you?\" is translated as \"Kayfa Haluka\", while in Saudi, it would be \"keef Halak\", while in Bahrini and Kuwaiti, it would be \"Eish Loonak\", the worst, however, is the egyptian \"Izzayyak\".\n\nSesotho\nSesotho, or Southern Sotho, is spoken in Lesotho, the Free State, the northern part of the Eastern Cape Province and the south of the Gauteng province of South Africa. It is also spoken in the vicinity of Pretoria and Brits.\nSesotho is used by 3 104 197 speakers as a home language in South Africa (1996 census).\nSesotho was one of the first African languages to be reduced to writing, and it has an extensive literature. According to scholars the written form was originally based on the Tlokwa dialect. Today the written language is mostly based on the Kwena and Fokeng dialects. Although there are variations.\n\nShona\nThe language of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Shona, or chiShona, is a language spoken by nearly 80 percent of people in Zimbabwe. There are several regional Shona dialects. Written Shona is constantly evolving. Unfortunately the language is deteriorating because of the tendency to assimilate foreign languages.\n\nSomali\nThe Somali language, one of the major languages in Africa, is spoken in Somalia /Somaliland, Kenya, Ethiopia and the Republic of Djibouti. In fact, it is one of the few that have 10 million or more native speakers in Africa. There are also communities of Somali speakers in most countries in East Africa, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.\n\nSotho (Northern)\nAmongst the immense diversity of the languages of Africa one finds the Bantu languages which number close to a thousand including dialects. Within the South\u00adeastern zone of the Bantu language family, sub\u00adgroups such as the Sotho and Nguni groups, Tsonga and Venda are distinguished, Northern Sotho belongs to the Sotho group together with Tswana and Southern Sotho. Geographically speakers of Northern Sotho are mostly concentrated in the Northern and North\u00adeastern parts of the Transvaal. There are about 3,5 million mother\u00adtongue speakers.\nTypologically Northern Sotho is an agglutinative language. It is characterised by a system of noun classes and concordial agreement. Concordance is established by means of prefixal elements. Tone plays an important role in distinguishing the lexical meaning of words, but is also used to determine the grammatical character of words.\n\nSotho (Southern)\nSesotho, or Southern Sotho, is spoken in Lesotho, the Free State, the northern part of the Eastern Cape Province and the south of the Gauteng province of South Africa. It is also spoken in the vicinity of Pretoria and Brits.\nSesotho is used by 3 104 197 speakers as a home language in South Africa (1996 census).\nSesotho was one of the first African languages to be reduced to writing, and it has an extensive literature. According to scholars the written form was originally based on the Tlokwa dialect. Today the written language is mostly based on the Kwena and Fokeng dialects. Although there are variations.\n\nSwahili\nThe language of Kenya and East Africa.\nThe Swahili language, is basically of Bantu (African) origin. It has borrowed words from other languages such as Arabic probably as a result of the Swahili people using the Quran written in Arabic for spiritual guidance as Muslims.\nAs regards the formation of the Swahili culture and language, some scholars attribute these phenomena to the intercourse of African and Asiatic people on the coast of East Africa. The word \"Swahili\" was used by early Arab visitors to the coast and it means \"the coast\". Ultimately it came to be applied to the people and the language.\nRegarding the history of the Swahili language, the older view linked to the colonial time asserts that the Swahili language originates from Arabs and Persians who moved to the East African coast. Given the fact that only the vocabulary can be associated with these groups but the syntax or grammar of the language is Bantu, this argument has been almost forgotten. It is well known that any language that has to grow and expand its territories ought to absorb some vocabulary from other languages in its way.\n\nSwazi\nXhosa, Zulu, Swazi, and Ndebele are languages in the Nguni group of Bantu (Guthrie S40). Xhosa is spoken in the Transkei coastal region of South Africa; Zulu, south of Swaziland inland and along the coast; Swazi, in Swaziland; all three are spoken in South Africa.\n\nTsonga\nAfrikaans, Ndebele, Northern Sotho, Sesotho (the Sesotho name for Southern Sotho), Setswana (the Setswana name for Tswana), Swazi (also known as Siswati), Tsonga (also known as Xitsonga), Venda (also isiVenda), Xhosa (also isiXhosa) and Zulu (also isiZulu) are 10 of the official languages of South Africa (the last and eleventh being English). All these languages are therefore predominantly spoken in South Africa.\n1,646,000 in South Africa (1995), 4.2% of the population (1995 The Economist). Population total all countries 3,165,000. Transvaal. Also spoken in Mozambique, Swaziland, Zimbabwe. Partially intelligible with Ronga and Tswa. National language. A language of secondary education. Newspapers, radio programs. Christian, traditional religion. Bible 1907-1989.\n\nTswana\nTswana, more correctly called Setswana, is another of the Bantu languages of southern Africa. Its speakers, the Tswana, number about 4 million\u20143 million of whom live in South Africa, and one million in the neighboring country of Botswana, which is named after them. Tswana is closely related to the Sotho language and, in fact, is often referred to as Western Sotho.\nA Bantu language. National Language of Botswana, which is named after the language; The majority of Tswana speakers are in South Africa but there are also speakers in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Internationally there are about 4 million speakers.\nThe language is closely related to Sotho and is in the Niger-Congo family of languages. It has also been known as Beetjuans, Chuana, Coana, Cuana, Setswana and Sechuana.\n\nVenda\nVenda is spoken/used in South Africa\n\nWolof\nWolof is a language spoken in the west African nations of Senegal and Coastal Gambia. Compared to isiXhosa or isiZulu, this language is fairly easy to learn and to enunciate.\n\nXhosa\nXhosa is a \"dominant language\" (Grobler et al.1990) in about three dozen districts of Eastern Cape Province and adjacent Orange Free State, and in the Transkei and Ciskei (all in South Africa). It is also spoken as a dominant language in several districts away from the main Xhosa region: in Petrusburg near Bloemfontein, and in the mining districts of Oberholzer and Westonaria, southwest of Johannesburg. Speakers of Xhosa total about 6.5 million. It is the most widely distributed African language in South Africa, although not the most spoken: Zulu has more speakers. Other speakers are found in major population centers throughout the Republic of South Africa. Afrikaans and English are official languages of South Africa, but Xhosa is a declared official language in Ciskei, along with English, and the official language in Transkei, although English, Afrikaans, and other African vernaculars are used for judicial, legislative, and administrative purposes (McFerren 1985).\n\nYoruba\nYoruba is spoken by about 30 million people in southwestern Nigeria, Benin, and northern Togo. Yoruba joins Hausa and Igbo as the most widely spoken languages in Nigeria. Although this member of the Benue Congo group of languages has about 20 distinct dialects, Standard Yoruba is recognized by speakers of all dialects and is used in education, literature, and the media.\n\nZulu\nThis prominent group of the Nguni people takes its name from the chief who founded the royal line in the 16th century. The warrior king, Shaka, raised the tribe to prominence in the early 19th century. The complicated Zulu etiquette was refined during his reign. The current monarch of the Zulu nation is King Goodwill Zweletini.\nThe language Zulu, or isiZulu, is understood by people from the Cape to Zimbabwe. Zulu is also the written language of the Northern Nguni. It's also a tonal language.\nPartner links:\nhttp://www.amlingua.com\nAMlingua provides Russian translation and transcription services by professional Russian translators.

Also links to useful translation tips.\nTranslator or Translation Rates, Charges, Prices and Fees\nThis page was written because many applying translators\nasked us for advice on what is a good translation rate and price to charge. If\nyou are a customer and would like to know our rates as a translation company,\nplease contactus directly, or check out our\ntranslation pricespage.\nSearching for \u201ctranslation\u201d on google will yield\napproximately 140 million results, making the translation industry very\ncompetitive indeed. Almost anyone can put a webpage together, and with roughly\n85% of the world population speaking at least two languages, you\u2019ve got\nsomething to contend with. Once you\u2019ve established a reputation for yourself and\npicked up a few steady customers you can start increasing your prices, but when\nbeginning your translation career it can be difficult to choose a rate to\ncharge. Below you will find various suggestions how to develop a pricing\nstrategy for your translation services.\nIf youare just starting\nout you may consider charging on the lower end, to help you get your foot in the\ndoor. After managing a translation company for 20 years and receiving lots of\ntender applications, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find quality translators in the\nfollowing price ranges:  \nWork\nat Home Translation Jobs\nEnglish/Spanish:\n0.04 - 0.06+ Euro/word\n\nFrench\n0.06+\nGerman\n0.06 - 0.08+\nScandinavian\n0.08 - 0.12+\nCzech, Polish\n0.04 - 0.06\nRussian, Uzbek etc.\n0.03 - 0.05\nHungarian\n0.05 - 0.07\nChinese/Asian\n0.04 - 0.05+\nAfrican\ncan be quite pricey and we do not have enough translators\n(or work) in these languages yet to offer accurate information on this.\nA seasoned translator can generally translate at least\n2,500 words a day, to give you an idea how much you could earn at these rates.\nI also received many offers which were lower, but the\nquality of their translation samples was generally undesirable \u2013 quite possibly\nfrom non-natives living in less expensive countries and who could afford to\ncharge such rates. Then again, some customers only require an \u201cinformative\u201d\ntranslation and the lower rates suit them.\nFor a particular language combinationyou may look at what\nother translators are charging according to how they filled in our translator\napplication form (we have more than 12,000 translators in our database). You are\nwelcome to add your own rate, but your details will not be added to our\ntranslator database. Note that rates charged to direct customers are\ngenerally higher than fees charged to translation companies. The % is a wild\ncard, so chin% would yield both \"chinese mandarin\" and \"chinese traditional\".\nHere are a few links of other websites posting recommended translator charges:\nProZ\nTranslators Cafe\nTranslators Base\nShare|\nHowever, from my experience, these appear to be rates\ncharged by translators who have an existing and well developed client base, or\ntheir \u201chopeful\u201d rates. What one writes on their CV or portfolio may differ from\nwhat they are willing to accept when bidding on an actual project.\nFor example, Translator Caf\u00e9\u2019s posted rates for Czech to\nEnglish translations are as follows:\nshowing an average of 0.08 USD/word charged by translators\nliving in the Czech Republic. On a local level though, I know it is very\ndifficult to get more than 250 Kc per target page, which works out to about 0.06\nUSD per source word. Local companies rarely pay more than this, and often less. I\u2019ve also applied to many tenders on ProZ and experimented with different\nprices, and anything over 0.06 is generally ignored. This is what Proz's statistics show for Czech to English rates:\nWhat is the best part of translating?\nTrend in Translation Prices\nIn short, the story goes as follows (as drawn\nfrom www.commonsenseadvisory.com): \nSo, with the internet opening up markets, increasing competition in some language combinations while increased trade with other countries is increasing demand for their languages, prices have become dynamic indeed.\nPossible Strategies When Deciding on What Translation Prices to Charge\npretend you are a potential customer, approach several\ntranslation companies and ask them what they would charge for a particular\ndocument. Companies will generally charge between 0.01 and 0.06 Euro/USD per\nword, possibly more, in addition to what the translator charges.\nbefore filling out many application forms you might want\nto phone around to a few translation companies and ask them what rate they\ngenerally offer their translators.\nwhen setting your price make a note somewhere that you\ncan be flexible with your fee, depending on the project particulars.\nwhen offering a price to a direct customer, consider what\ncompanies charge and offer something slightly less, but more than what the\ncompanies generally offer their translators.\nwhen bidding on tenders, scatter your prices and\nexperiment. If one customer accepts your higher offer, you are not bound to take\nwork from another offer where you submitted a lower price. With such\nexperimentation you can develop a \u201cfeel\u201d for the market.\nbefore submitting a price on a particular project, make\nsure that you understand the conditions (due date etc.) and take a good look at\nthe text. Try to translate some parts, at least in your head. If it is very\ndifficult for you and will take you longer to translate, you should raise your\nprice accordingly. On the other hand, rather than squeeze yourself out of the\nmarket, you may consider accepting a more competitive rate and use the\nopportunity to practice and research the field. Over time you will be able to\ntranslate faster, and during which you could have built up useful translation\nmemory and glossary terms. At least this way you will secure for yourself a\nsteadier supply of work, you could eventually be considered an expert and start\nraising your prices.\nif the deadline is short for the volume and you will have\nto work hard and long hours to meet the schedule, you should generally charge\nmore. But keep in mind that you are also earning more by translating the higher\nvolume over a shorter period of time, and your competition might be willing to\naccept their standard rate. Again, it is good to be vague with your pricing. You\ncan try a higher price, but if you need the work, you can mention words like\n\u201cflexible\u201d and \u201cI would liketo\ncharge\u201d.\nif you are receiving repeat and regular work from a\nsatisfied customer, you might consider asking them for a price increase. But\nalways be polite, as an offended customer is easily a lost customer, and winning\ncustomers in the first place can be a lengthy and time-consuming process.\nif you are getting more work than you can handle and from\ndifferent sources, this is the perfect time to increase your translation fee to\nnew customers. To convince potential new customers of your high quality\nservices, beef up your CV and website with testimonies from your existing\ncustomers, and translation samples from your more difficult projects.\nFollow-up: What to Do After Submitting Your Translation Price, Rate or Fee\nIf it is an important or large project, it is good to send\nyour offer from at least two sources/email addresses, to make sure your\npotential translation customer receives your application (because of spam\nfilters etc). If you do not hear back from them you can write in a few days to\nfurther express your interest. But keep in mind that such large and potentially\nlucrative projects can receive applications from many translators, and that the\nproject managers could be swamped trying to process them all. But by expressing\nyour keen interest you are revealing your enthusiasm, which is important, as\nwell as your potential to decrease your price, if that is an issue.\nOnce your potential client expresses interest in your\napplication they will often ask you to jump through some hoops, such as to\nprovide a free translation sample, references or other tedious and non-paying\nwork. If you have not done so already now is a good time to check out the\ncompany\u2019s\npayment reputation. If the company has a good reputation. If the company has a good reputation it is quite possible it could lead to\nlots of future work, in which case it is worthwhile to do the necessary prep\nwork. But make sure to do it properly, because any shortcomings could cast a\npoor impression. If you did not fill in their application form correctly, or you\nleft mistakes in your translation sample, they will think you will be lenient\nand that there could be many problems if they did decide to send you some work. For this you might like to read up on our translation project bidding\nsuggestions [..\nTo make yourself look better in the eyes of enquiring\ncustomers, you might also consider obtaining certification from one or more\nsources. Get tested and prove your abilities. If you provided good quality to\nother customers in the past, try to get a reference from them. If you\naccomplished some difficult translations and you are not dishonouring a\nnon-disclosure agreement, consider posting to your online profile some samples\nof your previous work. You are not only competing in price, so make sure you\nlook good to your potential client.\nIt\u2019s a competitive industry, but there\u2019s also a lot of work\nto be had, since the industry generally grows by 20% each year (relating to a\nglobalizing world and increased trade between countries). There are also many\nbenefits of working in the comfort of your home. Therefore, think sharp and good\nluck!\nShare|\nIf you have any suggestions or commentswe\u2019d love to hear\nback from you!\n[Jul 3, 2016] Wow what a through explanation,\nI was waiting for this article as I was very much confused about my translation rates to be asked from a client. Thanks you cleared much. I am an Indian Translator and got an offer from an Indian English writer to translate his best selling book into Hindi. Gave my rates though, what you think would be the rate for\nEnglish to Hindi translation of a 225 page book?\nAccording to the above database query, 94\ntranslators had submitted their rates for English to Hindi, the average working\nout to 0.061/w. But for a book I would usually offer a discount, and depends on\nhow difficult the translation is and the deadline. If you have more time for the\ntranslation, you can take on other work and use the big project as a filler, in\nwhich case you can offer more of a discount. Always turns out a bit of a dance\nand play with the customer when trying to set a final price. Make sure you get\npaid in installments as you make partial deliveries, unless you completely trust\nthe customer.\nKENAX Translation Services- Quality service at a competitive price\n| Contact\nThe previous text for this page (the updated version is above)\nThis could be a difficult subject for a translation agency\nto post, as the translator will always want to receive the most for their hard work, and\nthe translation agency always pay the least, so that it could win the most tenders. Basically it is a bidding war. Any agency, or even individual translator, can post their\nservice on the internet, where files and even payments can be effortlessly transferred as\nif the end client and translator were located in the same city. In fact, we have mediated\nwork where both the translator and the customer were located near to each other, without\neven knowing, while on the other side of the world from us.\nThis becomes the age old problem of determining what a translator or agency can charge or\nget away with. Companies have been battling this question since time immemorial and for\nthis reason corporate spying and espionage exist. It is always a great temptation to learn\nwhat the other translators on a particular tender are charging, and we try to offer this\ninformation to our translators if they ask.\nHistorically, there are several types of bidding processes. The bidding\nmay be open, so that everyone knows what the highest bid is. The bidding may start at some\nbasement price. Other times the bidding is closed, meaning the bidders have to guess, in\nwhich case they might end up paying substantially more than the second highest bidder.\nFor translations, the matter is made further complicated because the bidding is not on the\nsame product, meaning that the quality and speed offered by the individual translators\noften differs.\nSometimes a customer may require only an informative\ntranslation, not requiring great quality, nor even a translation by a native speaker. Hence the bidding \"war\" includes non-native speakers in lower cost countries.\nOther times the customer may demand a very high quality translation, to include a\nproofread by a quality translator, the subject matter can be very technical and require an\nexpert, and the customer may be willing to pay for this quality.\nOther times the customer may require something very quickly and is forced to pay whatever\nit takes to get the job done on time.\nThe way we like to work is to charge a low flat rate on top of whatever\nthe translator charges. With our global system of\ntranslation servicesand our project managers located on different time zones, we have\nmanaged to reduce our overhead to enable us to charge this low surcharge on top of\nwhatever the translator charges. This enables us to win more tenders, whereby we might end\nup using the same translator as any other agency, increase our volume, in turn reducing\nour markup further, to win more tenders and increase our volume further.\nSo no matter how much the translator charges or the customer agrees to pay, our markup\nwill always remain the same (although we may charge more for first time customers to cover\nthe risk of non-payment).\nIt may seem unethical for us to disclose what the other translators are\ncharging, as such opening up the table to a bidding war so to speak, but enough of our\ntranslators have asked for this information in the past, which is why we have decided to\nmake this information public (shown below).\nKeep in mind that these prices are a general guideline of the average charged by quality\ntranslators and do not necessarily represent some ceiling for us or what we hope to pay. Sometimes we get very large projects which need to be accomplished in very short periods,\nand for which we often resort to much more expensive translators, just to get the job done\non time. In these cases we would add up the total charge for the entire project, divide it\nby the number of words translated to calculate a per word price what it cost us, perhaps\noffer some discount to the customer because of the overall size of the project, and then\nround the figure to some nice sounding price, issuing an invoice to the customer based on\nthat.\nMost of our customers trust us and accept our strategy, and most of the time our estimate\nat the beginning of a project is very accurate. Other times the customer may demand a\nconcrete price in writing, in which case we would be forced to guess on the higher end, to\nprotect ourselves against the unforeseeable. This is just the usual issues of running any\nbusiness.\nFor each project we always ask the translator what they\nwould like to charge, and move forward from there. Perhaps a lot needs to be done over a\nholiday, or the subject matter is very technical. We never force our translator to agree\non a permanently defined price and they are always entitled to change their price at any\nmoment. Based on a preliminary response from our translators, we can then issue a price\nestimate to the customer, and if we win the tender based on that, then we can proceed from\nthere.\nFrom the perspective of the translator, perhaps they might be free at the moment and be\nglad to work full time on a project for a month, offering us a discount, which we could\nthen pass onto the client to help us all win the tender.\nOther times the translator can be busy with other work, charge something\nmore because of the headache of having to go into overtime, and we might accept the higher\nprice because the situation demands it and the customer's budget can afford it.\nOr other times the translator may have developed a good name for themselves, with steady\nclients sending them subject matters they are comfortable with. Such a translator is in an\nexcellent position, and can afford to charge a higher price to new clients. Heck, such a\ntranslator can even begin to farm out projects to other quality translators, control their\nwork, charge their own markup rate, increase their volume, and eventually begin to operate\nlike an agency. This is the wonderful power afforded by the internet. I myself translated\nfor 8 years and during which time I slowly migrated to operating only an agency. In fact,\nI still translate from time to time, although I much more enjoy project management and\ncompany development.\nMy suggestion is to always seek new customers when you do not have paying\nwork. If you want to develop an agency while most of your earnings comes from your own\ntranslation work, you can work on that on your own free time. When looking for new\ncustomers, you can spend your time approaching a list of translation agencieslike ours (or for a small fee have us do this\nfor you), or filling in their translator applicationforms, or provide them with free translation\nsamples. All this takes an investment of time. In the beginning you might offer a more\nattractive rate just to secure yourself with enough work, but over time, as you build up a\nreputation for yourself and steady clients with a steady stream of work, you can start to\ncharge more to new clients, or approach your existing customers and ask if they might\noffer you more, considering how reliable you have been for them all these years.\nYou might consider a premium rate for express work or on translations which need to be\naccomplished over the weekend or holidays. You may devise different rates for different\nsubjects or volumes. Everything is possible, and every business does this. Just think\nabout the airline industry, which charges premium rates for the business class who need a\nflight on short notice, while offering much cheaper rates for tickets bought well in\nadvance, or even lower rates for student or standby tickets. Which are tickets sold only\nwhen some seats remain available and just before takeoff. In economics and business\nlanguage this is called price discrimination, which in some ways can be considered illegal\nor unethical, but practiced nevertheless. For this purpose very complicated software\nprograms have been developed for the airline industry, estimating which seasons will be\nbusier, and formulating a complex price grid, all designed to maximize profits for the\nairline company by charging different prices to different people.\nSo you can certainly try your own price discrimination, although I do not think there is\nany software developed like this for the translation industry. You might approach a few\ntranslation agencies (by pretending you are a potential customer) and see what they charge\nfor your language combination and expertise, in turn charging them an appropriate price.\nWhen charging a direct customer as opposed to a\ntranslation agency, you might try charging something in between what an agency charges and\nwhat you would normally charge an agency. If you establish a good name with direct\nclients, there is no reason why you couldn't charge as much or more than the agency if you\nare really good or are knowledged in a special area, which your customer needs.\nWhen submitting your price to a new client, you can also be vague and try\nsomething on the higher end. You can say \"Some of my existing customers pay me\",\nor \"If possible\", and include \"price negotiable\", for example. You\nobviously want as much as possible, but you do not want to scare away your new potential\nclient either, so if you are quoting high, do not make it seem like your price is firm and\nset in stone - unless of course you are so well established you do not need to look for\nother customers. In such a case you are ideally established, and you might consider\nscreening your own translators and quality control their work, so that you can offer a\nhigher capacity.\nPrices often vary among language combinations precisely because of the\ncosts of living in those countries.\nTypically, translations in Scandinavian languages will cost a lot more than, for example,\nHindu or Russian translations. This has nothing to do with the quality of the respective\ntranslators but everything to do with the costs of living of the countries where these\nlanguages are mostly spoken. Of course, it may happen that a Swedish translator has\ndecided to move to Beijing China, has chosen to charge three times the local Beijing rate\nfor his translations from German and English into Swedish, is quite well off at those\nrates considering the cost of living in China, while offering a rate which is less than\nhalf what the average Swedish translator is forced to charge because they live in\nStockholm. So such a China based Swedish translator can benefit from lots of work and live\nquite well. This again is the strength (or for some, the annoyance) that the internet\noffers, but such is the fact of life in this increasingly global marketplace.\nThis is why you should consider the prices we have posted below as a very\nrough guideline. They are based on the prices of quality translators we have found. This\nis not to say that we have not found less expensive translators, like the quality Swedish\ntranslator living in China, but we have chosen not to post these \"extremes\" but\nrather just the average. There are also many translators who charge more than this, but at\nthe below prices we have not found it difficult to find quality translators.\nPossible Guideline to Help You Set your Prices\nAfter a debate on ProZ, I modified the below data and aspire to achieve some \"wiki consensus\".\nI will break up the prices according to the following. For those who are only just considering to start a career in translations, an average seasoned translator can translate between 2500 and 5000 words a day.\n1) Your Local Rates\nAsk your local translation agencies what they offer.\n2) According to Projects I have Managed in the Past (table above)\nThese generally reflect the lowest price levels offered by my quality native translators. It should also reflect the local prices for those countries, quite possibly on the higher end. It could be a good price suggestion for someone who would like to work on the global web translation market.\n3) ProZ's and Translator Caf\u00e9's Posted Rates\nProZ's rate data is only available for full paid members, but TC's is open to free members. Taking Czech to English translationsas an example (because I have many years and active experience in this language combination), TC's rates show the following:\nFrom my experience these definitely do not reflect local prices in the Czech Republic (TC's are significantly higher), so perhaps consider these as aspired prices. Or what would apply if you live in Western Europe. The translation market is a very competitive place so it's good to do some research and see what options are best for you. Or combine approaches and see where that leads to.\n4) According to Applicants in our Database\nThis tableis drawn from our own database of applicants, while removing the extremes (above 30 and below 1 cent a word). It is raw data only and the quality of the translators has not been verified. We get about 4 applicants a day, from all over the world.\nYou may add your own rate and I will continue to develop this as interest in it increases. The averages script timed out before it could make the complex calculations, so unfortunately it did not include all the language combinations (stopped at Portuguese to Turkish). I will try to resolve this later to include all the language combinations.\nOther Websites to Help you Choose your Translation Rates\nProZ\nTranslators Cafe\nTranslators Base\nShare|\nImportant Translator or Translation Rates, Charges, Prices and Fee Links\nTranslation Payments Reputation- before you\ntake on a translation project from a new client you should check out what other\ntranslators have said about their payment practices and if they are a reliable payer.\nGetting\nPaid for Translation Work- once you have translated for them but are finding\ndifficulties getting paid, read what a couple of international lawyers have said about\nextracting payment.\nTranslation\nTips- to help you do a good job translating, which will bring you repeated\ntranslation work and increase your chances of getting paid.\nTranslation Resources- links to various translator resources to help\nyou with your work.\nTranslation\nJobs- many forums and resources to help you find translation work.\nTranslation\nAgencies- or approach the agencies directly by email without hunting down their\naddresses on the net.\nTranslator Application- come join our growing team!", "docid": "msmarco_doc_00_89242"}
